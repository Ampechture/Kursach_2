abstract = {In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly set up 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all, which are commonly addressed as SDGs. In this blueprint, cities are seen as a hotspot for achieving those goals by 2030. In this context, cities, through smart technologies, are engaging in generating a sustainable ecosystem that is inclusive of social and environmental concerns. The main objective of this paper is to assess the effect of SDGs institutionalization on the concept of smart sustainable cities. To this end, we review the literature on smart cities and SDGs to analyze the degree of alignment and potential areas of development. The results reveal the existence of brokerage keywords, which rank high in both fields of the literature, but are missing from the portfolio of overlapping keywords. This is the case for water management, energy, governance, and collaboration. While concepts such as sustainability, waste management, civic engagement, and innovation are in common, albeit explored differently.}

The article proposes a definition for the capabilities maturity levels of the mobility ecosystem, and functional architecture for the collaborative decision-making system for implementing the C-ITS in the future Smart Cities. The paper contributes to the literature and practice in four manners. The first one is enhancing the awareness and understanding of maturity capability model (CMM) for all the stakeholders throughout the mobility ecosystem, emphasizing the key capabilities required for each maturity level. The second way is manifested throughout public and private companies acting on the same territory in the mobility ecosystem assess the existing capabilities and collaborate for achieving a superior maturity level of mobility processes, stable and repeatable results. In addition, the third one, based on CMM, is that governments regulate, conduct and control, establishing a stable and mature processes institutionalization for C-ITS. Finally, the fourth practice is defining a C-ITS functional architecture for the future Smart Cities to support collaborative decision-making applied for public transport implementation in big Smart Cities with the final objective of increasing the citizen’s quality of life.}

abstract = {Nowadays, with continuous integration of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, there are increasing demands and specific requirements for data sharing in sustainable smart cities: (1) practical data sharing should be implemented in the non-interactive fashion without a trusted third party to be involved; (2) dynamic thresholds are preferred since the participants may join or leave at any time; (3) multi-secret sharing is desirable to increase the packing capacity. To fulfil these requirements, we propose a general construction of ideal threshold changeable multi-secret sharing scheme (TCMSS) with information-theoretic security, in which polynomials are employed to achieve dealer-free and non-interactive in the secret reconstruction phase. The TCMSS scheme can be built on any existing linear secret sharing scheme, and it is simpler and more efficient than the existing TCSS schemes in the literature. The main difference between TCMSS and Shamir’s SS is that univariate polynomial is used in Shamir’s SS to generate the shares for all shareholders; while in TCMSS, each shareholder can recover her own univariate polynomial using her share. This article demonstrates that with this novel modification, the classic polynomial-based SS can be transformed into an ideal TCMSS. Moreover, the TCMSS scheme is lightweight and it can resist both internal and external attacks. It does not require pairwise key distribution and its secret reconstruction phase is improved with enhanced properties. Therefore, the designed proposal is fairly suitable and attractive to be deployed in sustainable cities.}

The research questions of the current study include: “Is it beneficial for countries, local governments, and autonomous districts with a high level of e-government to become smarter cities with the electronic, digital, and smart introduction of information and communications technology (ICT) technologies?” “Do cities with well-developed e-governments have a similar process from e-government to smarter cities?”, and “Do cities with similar levels of e-government or smarter cities go through different development processes in terms of their socio-cultural attributes?” This study focuses on the fact that e-government and smart cities, whose academic roots arose differently over time, are evolving to address governance, including next-generation e-government, urban e-government, and civic engagement, which has expanded to digital government and platform government concepts. Therefore, the scope of this study is set to e-government and smart/smarter cities as platforms. By comparing the key success factors of e-government with the smart city through a prior study, some intersections were found, but the success factors of the e-government and smart city were different. In order to explain the change of system from e-government to smart city as a platform in the socio-cultural attributes in which each case is involved, two cases—the Royal Borough of Greenwich and Seongdong-gu—were selected under similar conditions by comparing the e-government development level, economic indicators, and smart city development level. As a result of the case analysis, it was confirmed that the development level of e-government affected the smarter city process. The changes in the system from e-government to smart city was capable of being explained in different ways depending on the social and cultural attributes. In the process from e-government to smarter city, the case of Seongdong-gu, which has followed the informatization project and e-government development formula, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional overwrap, and the case of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, which was an active innovation agent for solving urban problems through public-private cooperation, was analyzed from the viewpoint of institutional transformation. In the Korean context with a collective hierarchical culture, citizens and stakeholders have participated in the public sector to the extent that they raise issues and express their preferences in policy-making decisions. The governments, including the autonomous district, have still treated citizens and stakeholders as guidance targets or customers rather than cooperative partners. On the other hand, the UK, which has an individualistic rational culture, citizens and stakeholders have become accustomed to maintaining cooperative relationships and operating cities based on partnerships as innovators. Since the socio-cultural contexts of each country have affected the actual system operations and changes, implementation plans and solutions under feasibilities need to take into account critical success factors and the socio-cultural properties of each autonomous district for the introduction, expansion, and establishment of smarter cities. This result of this study is that transferability considering sociocultural properties should be considered when introducing best practices, etc.}

These models, which support the IDS’s decision, could be vulnerable to a cyberattack known as adversarial attack. In this type of attack, attackers create adversarial samples by introducing small perturbations to attack samples to trick a trained model into misclassifying them as benign applications. These attacks can cause substantial damage to IoT-based smart city models in terms of device malfunction, data leakage, operational outage and financial loss. To our knowledge, the impact of and defence against adversarial attacks on IDS models in relation to smart city applications have not been investigated yet. To address this research gap, in this work, we explore the effect of adversarial attacks on the deep learning and shallow machine learning models by using a recent IoT dataset and propose a method using adversarial retraining that can significantly improve IDS performance when confronting adversarial attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the presence of adversarial samples deteriorates the detection accuracy significantly by above 70% while our proposed model can deliver detection accuracy above 99% against all types of attacks including adversarial attacks. This makes an IDS robust in protecting IoT-based smart city services.}

The methods of qualitative comparative analysis and logical generalization made it possible to identify the features of the content of Russian and international smart transport standards, to systematize management tools for achieving standardized indicators of smart transport in a smart city by the transport infrastructure. “Gaps” in the instrumental base in the Russian track of managing the development of smart transport are associated with the underuse of digital platforms and citizen initiatives that are widely represented in European practice. The scientific novelty of the results is achieved by a comparative approach to the tools for managing the development of smart transport in a smart city, consists of assessing the differences between Russian and European management tracks, of justified directions for using European experience in the Russian Federation. The paper provides practical recommendations for the inclusion of digital platforms with proven efficiency at the corporate level in management tools; for increasing the role of innovative initiatives of citizens in the formation of smart transport. Practical recommendations can be used in the development of transport strategies, transport sections of the strategies for the socio-economic development of the constituent entities and municipalities of the Russian Federation using not only program-project, but also platform-initiative goal-setting tools.}

Internet of Things (IoT) has a vital role in the smart city for vaccine manufacturing with wearable sensors. According to the advanced services in intelligent manufacturing, the fourth resolution is also changing in Industry 5.0 and utilizes high-definition connectivity sensors. Traditional manufacturing companies rely on trusted third parties, which may act as a single point of failure. Access control, big data, and scalability are also challenging issues in existing systems because of the demand response data (DRD) in advanced manufacturing. To mitigate these challenges, CoVAC: A P2P Smart Contract-based Intelligent Smart City Architecture for Vaccine Manufacturing is proposed with three layers, including connection, conversion, and intelligent cloud layer. Smart contract-based blockchain is utilized at the conversion layer for resolving access control, security, and privacy issues. Deep learning is adopted in the intelligent cloud layer for big data analysis and increasing production for vaccine manufacturing in smart city environments. A case study is carried out wherein access data are collected from the various smart plants for vaccines using smart manufacturing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. Simulation of the proposed architecture is performed on the collected advanced sensor IoT plants data to address the challenges above, offering scalable production in the vaccine manufacturing for the smart city.}

However, various strategies for determining cities' smartness/smart development levels are mostly inconclusive by not considering all the dimensions in urban space in their assessments. This study adopted a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) technique to model the smartness/smart development levels of a developing country city using a six-dimensional framework which provides a comprehensive perspective on the characterization of urban frameworks of cities. A positivism research philosophy using deductive approach and purposive sampling technique was adopted. Quantitative data were collected from experts using a close-ended questionnaire in which 76 responses were retrieved. The study modeled eight indicators for each of the six dimensions using FSE to determine the smartness/smart development level index of each dimension towards the determination of the overall smartness/smart development level index of the developing country city. After analysis, the developing country city and each of the six dimensions used to characterize the city were determined as fairly developed. The implications of such level of ranking meant that the city is below the acceptable smart city status, and hence, improvement should be made in policy applications along the 48 identified indicators such as empowering human resources, sustainable resource consumption, etc., to propel the six dimensions towards smart city. This study could also serve as a theoretical model for determining the smartness/smart development levels of developing countries’ cities. The study also reveals aspects in the urban framework where policy makers and urban developers could target to improve the smartness/smart development levels of cities towards the smart city status.}

In recent decades, academics and industry have spent considerable time and energy discussing security and privacy. Other systems, known as intrusion detection systems, are required to breach firewalls, antivirus software, and other security equipment to provide complete system security in smart operation systems. There are three aspects to an intrusion detection system: the intrusion detection method, the architecture, and the intrusion response method. In this study, we combined linear correlation feature selection methods and cross-information. The database used in this article is KDD99. This paper examines applying two feature selection methods in predicting attacks in intrusion detection systems based on INTERACT and A multilayer perceptron (MLP). Since the number of records associated with each attack type differs, one of our suggestions is to continue using data balancing techniques. As a result, the number of records associated with each type of network status becomes closer together. The results in the categories can also be improved using information synthesis methods, such as majority voting.}

This is possible by adopting next-generation energy systems, which leverage artificial intelligence, the Internet of things (IoT), and communication technologies to collect and analyze big data in real-time and effectively run city services. However, training machine learning algorithms to perform various energy-related tasks in sustainable smart cities is a challenging data science task. These algorithms might not perform as expected, take much time in training, or do not have enough input data to generalize well. To that end, transfer learning (TL) has been proposed as a promising solution to alleviate these issues. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first review of the applicability of TL for energy systems by adopting a well-defined taxonomy of existing TL frameworks. Next, an in-depth analysis is carried out to identify the pros and cons of current techniques and discuss unsolved issues. Moving on, two case studies illustrating the use of TL for (i) energy prediction with mobility data and (ii) load forecasting in sports facilities are presented.

It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making.

Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.}

abstract = {Based on the modified production function, economic and mathematical modeling of production factors was carried out in the conditions of the development of a smart transport organization (Municipal public enterprise «Tulgorelektrotrans») and a smart city. The trends and methods of interaction between a smart organization and a smart city are proposed for the transformation of the digital economy of the city and the implementation of the goals of harmonious development. The existing scientific and methodological approaches to simulating the digital development of economic systems are systematized. On the basis of the modified production function, the substantiation of qualitative and quantitative changes in production factors for the smart city of Tula and smart organizations, taking into account the "digital" factor, is carried out. Formal dependencies made it possible to conduct a numerical assessment of the "smart" factor in the production of its own volume of shipped goods, completed works and services (for the city of Tula as a whole and for certain types of economic activity). The marginal rate of substitution by the smart labor factor was 2.28, and capital – 0.66.}

The aim of this communication paper is to discuss the SC hubness and more specifically the fact that the SC can become a “hub” that collects, processes, and transmits data; brings together people to co-design and evolve; and controls service, material and people flows in all city types. As a result, this paper defines the role, the uses and the architecture of this “SC-as-a-Hub” operation labeled “SCHub”, which can standardize and control all the city flows.}

A data migration strategy was proposed to handle the various data sources such as IoT devices, video cameras, and drones. The proposed approach also takes into account data processing and data storage. The technical constraints related to data processing in a big-data environment are also studied. We also consider data modeling from a business intelligence point of view and a data science perspective. Our main goal is to favor the facilitation of the daily life practices in the context of a smart city by providing the city administrators with a solution that helps them maintain their city smartly and effectively.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

However, cyber security has always been a serious problem, and it is becoming more and more severe in smart cities. The existing attack defense methods are not suitable for detecting multi-step attacks since the detection rules are limited and the efficiency is limited by a large number of false security alarms. Hence, an advanced solution is urgently needed to improve cyber security defense capability. In this paper, we propose a novel attack detection framework called ACAM. To better represent the cyber security knowledge, the framework is based on the MDATA model, which can represent dynamic and temporal–spatial knowledge better than the knowledge graph. The framework consists of the knowledge extraction module, the subgraph generation module, the alarm correlation module, and the attack detection module. These modules can remove false alarms and improve the detection capabilities of multi-step attacks. We implement the framework and conduct experiments on the cyber range platform, the experimental results validate the good performance of attack detection accuracy and efficiency. The framework can greatly improve the cyber security defense capabilities for smart cities.}

In this article, Energy Efficient Integrated Planning Framework (EEIPF) has been proposed for sustainable smart cities to enhance energy efficiency and performance. Energy efficiency planning over smart cities involves the primary and secondary strategies used in modern cities to improve energy efficiency. Integrated Planning Framework provides a numerical model for selecting energy efficiency methods to optimize economic and environmental impacts.

However, the approach faces challenges when multiple goals shall be simultaneously achieved. For illustration, we study a multi-agent system, where agents have a plurality of different, and mutually inconsistent goals. We then allow agents in the system to vote on which traffic signal controllers, which were trained on different goals using deep reinforcement learning, would control the intersection. Taking decisions based on suitable voting procedures turns out to lead to favorable solutions, which perform highly for several goals rather than optimally for one goal and poorly for others. This opens up new opportunities for the management or even self-governance of complex systems that require the consideration and achievement of multiple goals, such as many systems involving humans. Here, we present results for traffic flows in urban street networks, which suggest that “democratizing traffic” would be a promising alternative to centralized control of traffic flows.}

In order to further identify the key influencing factors and clarify the importance of the factors, the interval gray number-DEMETAL method is used to identify the key factors that induce multiple interest conflicts in the construction of smart city PPP projects to enhance the identification effect. The research shows that: the complexity of the project, the comprehensive quality of project personnel, and the differences in ideological and cultural concepts have become the main factors. Project social benefit, project quality compliance rate, project profit rate or rate of return become the most important result factors. Government behavior is the primary influence and restriction of the interest conflict in the construction of smart city PPP projects. In addition, interest conflicts are closely related to other project stakeholders, especially the private sector, social capital, and public behavior. Therefore, the government's decision-making behavior and incentive and restraint mechanism must first examine the interests of stakeholders and their behavior strategies, especially the behavior evolution trend under the government's incentive and restraint mechanism, which implement a flexible incentive and restraint mechanism.}

It analyzes the current situation and existing problems of EPI, environmental information disclosure level (EADI), and financial performance of the coal industry and enterprises. The raw coal output and growth rate in China from 2015 to 2021, the output of major coal-producing areas from 2018 to 2021, and the revenue and profit statistics of coal enterprises from 2017 to 2021 are collected and studied. The quantitative indicators (financial performance, EPI, and EADI) are selected to verify the results. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and moderating effect analysis are chosen to analyze the related explained, explanatory, intermediary, and control variables. Among them, there is an obvious positive correlation between the EPI and the EADI of coal enterprises, and the EPI of coal enterprises has a positive impact on financial performance. The EADI of coal enterprises plays a partial mediating effect on the impact of EPI on financial performance. Additionally, the correlation analysis determines the correlation between EPI, EADI, and the financial performance of coal enterprises. Finally, the regression analysis is carried out again by replacing variables. The regression results are consistent with the previous conclusions, increasing the empirical results' robustness. It is concluded that improving the EADI will give enterprises better future financial data.}

This model is inherently multidisciplinary and is methodologically processed using multi-criteria decision analysis, which is aggregated using four distinct weighting schemes. The model results reveal that based on the equal weighting scheme, Sydney emerges as the city with the highest SCI score of 0.72, whereas Lima is identified as the city with the lowest SCI score of 0.26. On the other hand, based on the sustainability triad scheme, Toronto tops the list with an SCI score of 0.77, whereas Abuja scores the lowest with an SCI score of 0.31. Interestingly, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal continue to maintain their position among the top 5 cities across all three schemes: equal weighting, sustainability triad, and energy-focused schemes. Furthermore, the energy-focused scheme identifies Montreal as the top-performing city, scoring 0.7, followed by Oshawa at 0.67, and four Canadian cities top the SCI scores in this scheme. In contrast, Lima still remains at the bottom of the list with an SCI score of 0.27. Finally, based on a smart health-focused scheme, Sydney, Osaka, and Hämeenlinna rank highest in SCI scores. Overall, the proposed approach and model provide valuable insights and guidelines for policy-makers and urban planners to design and implement smart city initiatives that can significantly enhance sustainable development and improve quality of life in urban settings.}

It examined the range and frequency of inclusive strategies that were proposed by cities in their applications and the differences between successful and unsuccessful proposals. After reviewing and analyzing documentation from both rounds, we conclude: (1) insufficient attention was given to these underrepresented population groups in the proposals; (2) more ISC strategies are needed to address these groups’ needs and guarantee their rights; (3) government policies to support ISCs are needed to insure that the implementation of Smart City ideas addresses the needs of these groups; and, (4) universal design practices could be used to address the needs of many underrepresented populations.}

abstract = {The world is facing substantial challenges related to population growth and the derived pressure on environment, energy, and other natural resources. Cities contribute to these problems due to the ever-increasing urbanization. As a solution, smart cities are managed and optimized across traditional boundaries and through the exchange of information between physical objects, citizens, and stakeholders. However, there are barriers in the development of smart cities that should be overcome in order to meet these challenges through smart cities. The main barriers identified in this work are poor private-public participation, utilization of fossil fuels, lack of attention to the environment, insufficient internet technology (IT) infrastructure, and old technology throughout the cities. To overcome these barriers, policies must be implemented to improve private-public participation by encouraging public investments and a wider adoption of electrical vehicles that may act as storage device and provide ancillary services to the electricity grid; reduce the use of private cars; strengthen IT infrastructure, deployment of smart technology to allow residents to monitor and control their energy consumption, installation of roof-top solar panels, and better mobility and efficient public services supported by smart technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the interconnection among smart city systems.}

One of the main challenges that resulted from the exponential spread of IoT is the dense number of nodes with the huge amount of data over different networks that influence the collision probability, and network congestion. Existing aggregation techniques worked to solve these challenges with overlooking the IoT traffic characteristics and their types. In this paper, adaptive aggregation techniques are proposed based on IoT traffic types to overcome IoT network issues. These techniques can abstract data, reduce number of packets sent with low traffic congestion, and reduce the recurring packet headers. The proposed adaptive aggregation techniques are accomplished over the IoT smart city networks that are architectured and practically tested to examine the simulation results. It is anticipated that the adaptive aggregation results could optimize the operational efficiency of IoT smart city networks in most key performance metrics, compared to the existing aggregation techniques.}

This article uses the research object of the smart city construction model to study the advantages of smart city construction based on big data and rational planning theory and its impact on people’s lives. This article differs from previous qualitative research on smart cities, from the perspective of quantitative research based on the dual difference method to assess whether smart cities can provide a new impetus to economic growth. The results of the research show that the construction of smart cities can significantly promote regional economic growth and the DID rate is stable between 0.054–0.059 and the construction of smart cities can promote regional economic growth by 5.4% to 5.9%. Improving the efficiency of urban enterprises, thus leading to regional economic development. Building a smart city requires residents to be able to live independently, seek development, serve others and serve society using media and information technology. There is a link between promoting the construction of smart cities and improving the media literacy of residents. Improving media information literacy of residents will help fully unleash the vitality of smart city construction.}

A travelogue describes Kochi as ‘magical without any trace of trickery’. It is among the 100 Indian cities selected to be transformed into a smart city. The population of the city region is expected to reach 2.27 million by 2031. This drastic increase calls for an urgent examination of several key aspects of the city infrastructure in order to ensure that Kochi is able to live up to the standard of a smart city. It is important to ensure the quality of urban development by studying the city's location at the junction of several ecosystems. Further, this paper looks beyond the smart city vision to making Kochi a creative city as well. Kochi has a unique mixture of ethnicity, culture, architecture and cuisine owing to the influence of traders from around the world as well as various parts of India. Thus, Kochi possesses the potential to push creative, knowledge-based economic activities. Strategies should be developed to encourage education and employment generation such that a creative class of people and occupations can flourish in the city.}

The results show that implementing a smart city construction policy improves the urban innovation output, and that the effect on the degree of urban innovation was relatively significant after implementation. A further heterogeneity analysis showed that smart city development in different regions has different impacts on urban innovation; specifically, compared with the central and western regions, smart city construction in eastern China was seen to have a higher impact on urban innovation output. Moreover, the findings also demonstrated that smart city construction policies have different impacts on urban innovation output in cities of different urban scales. Namely, applying the smart city construction policy to medium-sized cities will exert a positive effect on urban innovation.

In recent years, the concept of a “smart city” has attracted attention, and therefore the competition between cities has increased even more. Although various indices published regularly have been developed, no approach makes use of a systematic methodology. The gap in the literature constitutes the main motivation of this study. From this point of view, the study aims to measure the smartness level of cities by performing integrated grey-based methods. In this manner, a grey extension of an integrated Level Based Weight Assessment (LBWA) & Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method has been proposed. Six criteria are weighted with the LBWA-G method, and the performances of 17 European cities are measured by the EDAS-G method. The criteria and cities’ related data are derived from the Global Power City Index (GPCI). Furthermore, sensitivity and comparative analysis are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methodology. The findings of our study offer many managerial implications. We think that this study will guide administrative and local administrators to carry out corrective action for moving forward and developing their cities.}

SC services can make the daily routines more efficient, create more public value, and improve the urban sustainability and life quality (QoL). However, before any technology enters the market, the factors making adoption easier for the end-users should be examined. Here, we aim to examine the acceptance of IoT-based and sustainability-oriented SC services. This study proposes a SC services acceptance model (SCSAM), built over the human, technology and institution dimensions of SC. We tested SCSAM by using structural equation modeling via 640 survey-respondents. The quantitative findings were supported by qualitative analysis of 10 semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that personal innovativeness, social influence, quality of service (QoS) and perceived trust are the significant determinants of use intention. Interestingly cost has no significant effect and demographics do not contribute much on the acceptance of smart services. This is the only study in the literature adopting both quantitative and qualitative analysis to examine SC services adoption via an acceptance model based on the SC's multidimensional structure. Our findings would help city administrators and service providers to improve urban sustainability and QoL.}

abstract = {Achieving a sustainable state in smart cities would require ongoing monitoring and evaluation of all activities in different dimensions. Hence, it is essential to use smart systems and adaptable, reliable, and controllable schemes in all dimensions of smart cities. This paper focuses on the on-demand wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) to allow for ongoing and sustainable monitoring and provide application-based services matching goals, conditions, and the environment within in smart cities. Overcoming the challenge of energy limitation, WRSNs are more reliable than wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Hence, the paper proposes a calibration fuzzy-metaheuristic clustering routing scheme (CFMCRS) for on-demand WRSNs. The proposed CFMCRS benefits from resource-saving and energy supplementary techniques in addition to using metaheuristic and fuzzy logic methods to manage roles and energy distribution in nodes and across the network. It also uses a multiobjective function to match and calibrate the network with the nearest-job-next with preemption (NJNP) charging scheduler to meet WRSN requirements in smart cities. The extensive simulation results of the proposed CFMCRS were compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of energy efficiency, latency, minimum sustainability rate, dead rate, survival rate, mean energy of network, number of packets received by base station (BS), request rates, and sensitive analysis. Accordingly, the proposed scheme outperformed the other methods by far for application requirements and improved evaluation factors for application. Ultimately, it can prolong the WRSN lifetime. The simulation results were also validated through ANOVA and its subsequent post-hoc analysis.}

Therefore, it is necessary to advance the service qualities of Internet of Things (IoT) applications because the data produced by all these devices will need to be processed quickly and sustainably. Previously, cloud data centers with large capacity interface IoT devices with support servers. While IoT devices proliferate and generate massive amounts of data, communicating between devices and the Cloud is becoming more complex and harder, resulting in high costs and inefficiencies. Fog computing emerges as an approach to address the growing demand for IoT solutions. In this article, an IoT-fog-cloud application’s general framework is developed, followed by an algorithm for Energy efficiency through an integrated approach computation model. Fog-Enabled Smart Cities (FESC) are proposed to minimize service delay and response time by using a fog offloading policy for the fog-enabled IoTs. Also, we developed an analytical model evaluating the proposed framework's effectiveness in reducing the delay of IoT services. Comparing the proposed model and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM-VS) algorithm, the proposed model performs significantly better. Thus, by optimizing response and processing times, fog-enabled smart grids determine whether computation will be performed autonomously or semi-autonomously on fog nodes or in the Cloud.}

For this purpose, they conducted representative surveys in 287 Polish cities, taking into account 5 groups of parameters related to the subsequent stages of the evolution of smart cities. According to the obtained results, the key barrier to the development of smart cities in Poland is the unsatisfactory level of prosperity of the residents and the difficult financial situation of cities, which means that the vast majority of the surveyed areas are not able to attempt to get closer to the Smart City 1.0 generation. In contacts with stakeholders, Polish cities prefer the triple helix model, focused on business cooperation and creating favourable conditions for commercial entrepreneurship. Relationships of higher order helices (with communities or ecological organisations) are not a priority for them, which may contribute to the aggravation of urban pathologies in the form of unsustainability and socio-economic exclusion. Conclusions and recommendations resulting from the research contribute to the economics of smart cities and can be used in the practical improvement of the process of their creation and development.}

Second, if smart city app empowers citizens, what specific features or characteristics of the App are critical drivers of empowerment and the subsequent satisfaction? To answer these two questions, we develop a theoretical framework based on empowerment theory. We argue that smart city app artifacts are linked to citizens’ psychological, social, and political empowerment, and empowerment, in turn, shapes citizens' satisfaction with both the smart city technology and government. Using Jakarta's smart city app Qlue as the research context, we explore how Qlue enhances citizens' empowerment based on survey data from 358 users. The results verified that the app's IT artifacts, especially external properties such as addressability, sensibility, communicability, and associability, play a crucial role in citizen empowerment, leading to higher psychological, social, and political empowerment. Internal properties are related to psychological empowerment only, giving citizens more feelings of control with its programmability, traceability, and memorability features. Empowered citizens, in turn, are generally more satisfied with both the App and the government.}

The sophistication of the energy networks and their critical function make energy management one of the most challenging urban centers' problems. The essential methods are widely used to determine intelligent technologies' technical and policy impacts for modeling and simulation Planning to move from existing towns to smarter ones. Energy consumption has been increasing due to the growing population and intensified in dense metropolitan centres. It has changed Energy consumption, resulting in a strong demand for oil and electricity and more pollutants and heat production in these urban areas. This paper looks at energy-related work on smart city models and planning by classifying their spectrum based on active and passive approaches and infrastructure management models. The purpose of this paper is to examine economic performance determinants and to determine the energy protection requirements of smart cities for efficient energy management based on active and passive models. Further, the paper’s principal approaches include the economic study of upgrades to infrastructure, leading to a decline in the smart cities' energy demand identified by the street lighting intelligent diode (LED). Our results indicate that smart city models are designed to pursue alternatives to promote more clean energy sources on grids with smart linked urban energy storage systems. Our findings may be of great concern to city planners, municipal residents, and urban decision-makers interested in smart cities' design and operation.}

abstract = {Recently, the population density in cities has increased at a higher pace. According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97% of Scopus and 73% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23% impact), mobility (19% impact), privacy and security (11% impact), and energy sectors (10% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gendered dimensions of this smart city district through gender analysis. This paper analyzes the planning, implementation, and post-occupancy stages of the district through a review of guidelines of gender-mainstreaming policies of Korean cities, interviews of experts involved, and a survey of 100 residents to gain an insight into how users perceive the spatial aspects of the women-friendly walking environment. Results show that, at the planning stage, little interprofessional communication occurs between smart city experts and ‘women-friendly city’ experts. At the implementation stage, this leads to incomplete gender-mainstreaming of the district. Post-occupancy survey results reveal, however, that despite these shortcomings, both women and men perceive the ‘Specially Designed Zone for Women’ to be safe. Even so, there is a gender difference in the perception regarding smart installations. CCTVs are more important to men than women, while on-site emergency bells are more significant to women than men. This indicates that women need more active safety systems than passive surveillance systems. This paper argues that a gendered perspective is needed for the more inclusive planning of smart cities.}

Further, the CPS stationing has improved the quality of various services like healthcare, transportation, environmental, etc., provided in a typical smart city ecosystem. But, the embodiment of CPS has also increased the surface area for cyber-attacks. In this paper, the various security and privacy issues at the different levels in the architecture of a smart city are discussed. The domain-centric security issues evolved with the deployment of CPS in transportation, healthcare, smart grids, and smart homes are also explored. Scopus publications for the years 2016–2020 are considered for the bibliometric analysis in security. It has been observed that a major number of security solutions have been proposed in the domain of smart homes during these years, whereas much scope is still there to address security and privacy challenges for CPS equipped smart grids. But over time, the security of smart grids is also becoming an area of interest for researchers. The article is concluded with the research gaps and future scope to cater secure smart city services.}

The advent of digital platforms and dedicated mobile apps, as well as new business models based on the concept of access over ownership and sharing economy (sharing mobility and Mobility as a Service), promises to reshape this sector. It will facilitate and speed up the diffusion of more sustainable and efficient means of transportation based on an intermodal mobility management perspective. The main goal of this paper is to examine the current state of smart mobility together with those factors that may influence the extent of modern sharing mobility proliferation and penetration through ICT applications and social media. The authors applied the content analysis using a sample of more than 1000 citizens' and visitors' reviews published on the official digital platforms of the smart city of Milan. The paper includes a comparison with data drawn from the public urban mobility services users. Based on the nodes resulting from the content analysis, the STEEP method was adopted in order to apply a more complex perspective concerning social, technological, environmental, economic and political issues. This strategic analytical tool was combined with the SWOT analysis dimensions to provide a comprehensive practical contribution to modern municipal smart mobility management systems. The results highlight the need for both smart mobility solutions suppliers and institutions to properly understand and communicate how digital services can be implemented across different users' touchpoints and communication channels to increase the value-added provided to citizens and visitors alike.}

The annual World Health Organization reports indicate that many people die from preventable diseases as a result of improper waste disposal and management. The provision of garbage bins is inadequate in the management of solid waste in smart cities. The major problem is that garbage bins fill up quickly, and it takes time for the municipal workers to empty the bins. This paper focuses on a real-time smart garbage bin mechanism for solid waste management in smart cities. Conventional garbage collection and management systems have many shortcomings, including inaccessibility to actual data required, lack of throughput, and late unloading. The mechanism proposed accesses real-time information of any smart garbage bin deployed across the city and helps to resolve the problem of waste overflow from garbage bins and keep the smart cities clean. Fuzzy logic is applied in the strategic deployment of smart garbage bins across the smart cities. The system is implemented on Net-logo which is widely used in multi-agent modelling environments. The significant advantage of the system is its novelty in real-time decision-making and real-time monitoring using the fuzzy logic process.}

Rooftop photovoltaics is a promising solution for sustainable energy production in urban environments. Understanding their potential and their obstacles is critical for their better performance and establishment, both in financial and environmental terms. The main factors that influence solar photovoltaic efficiency are the percentage of sunlight and the power capacity, that's why many studies have proposed various installed power capacity assessment models and they have tried to analyze the so-called shadow effect. Ιn a more inclusive context, smart energy or renewable cities, an advanced term of smart city scenario, are a concept that implies that not only individual owners will benefit of the advantages from renewable sources, but whole places will integrate physical, digital, and human systems in traditional networks and services to better use energy resources and reduce emissions to the benefit of citizens and businesses. Already many countries around the world, with several policies and proposals, are promoting more sustainable urban areas with the use of latest smart technologies and renewable energy sources. Examples given from many different countries are analyzing the installation process, the financial benefits, the local policies, and other factors that affect rooftop PVs in various study cases. The concept of Smart Renewable Cities refers to cities that are willing or have already made a commitment for a green transition focusing on the production of electricity by the use of renewable energy sources, mainly solar and wind energy. Smart city, smart energy city, and smart renewable city terms are developed and analyzed with corresponding examples and references at global and local level.}

Based on the data of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the smart cities projects investment in China cities, our empirical results show that smart city projects have significantly reduced the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Specifically, for every 1 million yuan increase in smart city investment per 10,000 people, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases per 10,000 people would decrease by 0.342. The heterogeneity analysis results show that the effect of the smart city projects on COVID-19 in the spread phase inside a city is stronger than that in the input phase. In addition, the effect differs for cities with different population sizes. This study provides quantitative evidence of the impact of smart city projects on COVID-19 prevention and control.}

The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications. Finally, based on a literature review, the study highlights the current challenges and future directions related to multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities, which provide a roadmap for the optimized operation of megacities and smart city systems.}

This framework presents an interrupt access control scheme that exhibits survivability characteristics important to mission-critical applications. Analytically, the author's concept is represented by an irreversible Markov process, for which a system of equilibrium equations and stationary probabilities are defined. Based on the latter, a qualitative metric was formulated, which included such indicators as the average number of requests accepted for service in the 5 G cluster, the probability of losing an incoming request, and the average volume of network resource units used in the 5 G cluster. For the single input data that characterizes a real NS 5 G cluster, a comparison of the author's and known competing access control schemes in terms of formulated qualitative metrics is implemented. The obtained results showed that the author's concept prevails over the competitor in the range of low loads. Note that in this range, the advantage of the author's scheme over the competitor significantly increases with the increase in the number of network segments into which the information environment of the 5 G cluster is divided.}

Such uncertainty has led to the techno-centric versus human-centric debate currently dominating the Smart City discussion. This paper adopts a systems approach to stratify society into three strata: the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and system (macro). I implement a systematic review of the Smart City literature to examine how Smart Cities are conceptualized. From an analysis of 41 papers, this research identifies a dualistic phenomenon occurring at all points in the stratified city system: sources of innovation (SOI) and Loci of change (LOC). Here, SOI refers to the perceptions of deficiencies which initiate the learning curve of innovation, while LOC refers to the structures which allow the learning curve to disseminate through the system. This analysis highlights an overemphasis on the organizational stratum and insufficient attention to the individual and system strata. To address this shortfall, I introduce the Social Innovation Cycle. This multi-level social innovation framework incorporates the interdependencies of SOI and LOC to link all strata, mitigate power asymmetries, and reduce marginalization. In so doing, I delineate where policy implementation can be directed for holistically developing the Smart City. I recommend that Smart City policy should target the intersection of SOI and LOC in pursuit of human-centricity.}

abstract = {A city-wide communication network capable of supporting a range of applica- tions should be established through the use of wireless sensor networks that collect, analyze, and act on data in order to provide solutions for smart city im- plementation. A smart city network confronts a number of obstacles, including changing the network's coverage area to accommodate different applications, non-uniform node distribution, an increase in message volume, the use of multi- ple communication technologies, and node and message heterogeneity. Numer- ous aspects of smart cities are being investigated, with a few applications being developed in each. This article conducts a survey to describe various sensor network choices for smart cities. The research explores message transmission challenges via the lens of applications such as taxi sharing, ambulance services, and other emergency services that rely on real-time traffic data provided by the smart traffic domain to work successfully. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are employed in a range of areas due to its advantage in rapidly establishing networks. The network will perform ideally if mobile nodes collaborate and trust one another; hence, message transmission for this service, as well as the utility of MANET routing algorithms, are examined.}

This study's novelty lies in the context of its analysis and theoretical contribution, which outline an identification of the complexity, advantages and barriers that smart city project managers perceived in an ongoing smart city cluster project. Further, a definition for a smart city project is suggested. This research is within a case study methodology, and was based on a mixed method approach that employed nine key informant interviews and two questionnaires. The results revealed that the project managers perceived different needs and goals within the context of smart city innovation and realization. The project managers perception of smart city was mainly within a smart economy and smart governance perspective. However, the project managers also criticized the relatively less focus on public participations and dialogue-oriented smart city solutions. The perceived major barriers to real smart city implementations were regulations; silos; and the choice of stakeholders, including companies promising too much. The major advantages include the different perspectives and types of knowledge of various stakeholders.}

These could also be addressed by means of context-aware fog computing at the edge of the network and also by incorporating intelligence at the network edge. Since workload at fog nodes can anytime see sudden changes in demand, hence load migration among fog nodes becomes viable. However, improper migration can lead to further migrations, eventually decreasing performance. In this paper, we present a multi-channel queuing model based smart distributed service management approach and an intelligent resource-aware forecasting technique to predict the required context and resource management. The scheme accomplishes live migration by a resource-aware ensemble forecast method that used current and predicted resource utilization and their context availabilities to address the delay requirement for cross-domain IoT applications. The proposed management algorithms are simulated using CloudSim simulator and the efficacy of the obtained results confirm the superiority of the proposed methods.}

abstract = {Nature inspired artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are gaining traction in air quality modeling. A mathematical simulation of how air pollutants distribute and react in the atmosphere to impact ambient air quality is known as air quality modeling. Modeling aids in estimating the correlation between pollution levels and their impacts on air quality. Outdoor ambient air quality is important because it affects indoor air quality. Unprecedented growth of urban agglomeration, population blast, and unrestricted use of natural resources as well as nonrenewable fuels eventually results in higher pollution and driving the world away from the sustainable development goals. Rising air pollution levels around the globe is an alarming situation for all lifeforms. It also affects the nonliving things such as structures, metals, and water bodies. In this chapter, to predict air quality in seven Indian smart cities, a data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) is merged with particle swarm optimization (PSO), a nature-inspired optimization technique. The PSO technique presented in this chapter functions as an ANN optimization technique. The data were obtained from the online web repository called Kaggle. The data-sets for 12 pollutants were selected for 7 Indian smart cities. The datasets were recorded during the last 5 years from 2016 to 2020 and were included for computation. Models can be used by air quality managers to forecast the effects of prospective new emissions. Policy makers often use models to predict ambient air pollution concentrations under various scenarios as a decision-making tool. Because of the robustness and effectiveness of AI models, the public will be able to get early warning for a high concentration level of pollutants in big cities, potentially lowering cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The findings proved PSO's outstanding performance while evaluating high-dimensional data.}

We use an inductive qualitative case study approach based on connecting emergent concepts through Gioia's method to answer the following research question: “How can hybrid organizations manage a complex network of actors in smart city initiatives?”. The study highlights that in managing smart city initiatives, hybrid organizations benefit from actor-network theory. Additionally, for a more in-depth view, the study investigates the framework provided by Chourabi to test the hybridity theory. Overall, the results suggest that hybridity is feasible and increases the output directed towards citizens. The paper contributes to the existing literature on both hybrid organizations and smart cities. We conclude that despite the conventional distinction between public and private entities, managing smart city initiatives that include complex factors such as new technologies may require the adoption of hybrid management solutions by urban planners, especially when multidisciplinary and complex skills are required. Thus, smart city solutions are most effective when combined with hybrid management models. This research has utility for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers. It aims to support practical management solutions (analysed through a theoretical lens) to foster smart city initiatives.}

The paper offers extensive empirical analysis in the three cities of Bhubaneswar, Pune and Chennai that are among the first 20 smart cities prioritised for implementation. We first analyse how the governance framework provided by the Smart Cities Mission in India unfolds at three spatial scales – national, state and local – with the intersection of the scales differing in the three cities. Second, our analysis of the new form of governance involving public–private actors shows the conflict of responsibilities on a local scale. In conclusion, we highlight the absence of collaborative governance and reduced capacity in local governments – as significant challenges for smart city development in India.}

An examination of the academic literature since the early 2000s reveals the unfolding of spatiotemporal trends relating to this concept. It has been emerging to represent a sector-specified version of its sister concept of smart cities, also popularized in the past decade. However, the idea of the smart energy city has its own historic precursors and nationally specific trajectories. It rose from concerns with energy efficient/green buildings as well as smart grids for low carbon and distributed energy generation and distribution, which were later scaled up to the whole urban scale, and to embrace multiple other urban sectors and urban domains. By so doing, and combining the developments in ICT-led smart cities and sustainable energy, the notion of the smart energy city has come close to represent a digitally-mediated variant of low carbon cities. It can, thus, be conceptualized as a blend of smart cities and low carbon cities. National and urban case studies help to further distinguish “actually existing” projects, patterns, and conceptualization relating to both smart cities and smart energy cities and barriers to their practical integration. A greater focus on intersystem integration and a multistakeholder approach more recently offers a stronger representation of interdisciplinarity and conveys the complexity of the system involved, where humans and social systems become increasingly more central.}

Due to the problems arising from urbanisation, local governments construct smart cities as inherent innovative advantages that can improve their level of science and technology, and efficiency in resource allocation, thereby reducing environmental pollution. Through this innovation-driven channel, shocks to the degree of city smartness can have a significant impact on the regional environment. In order to compute the sensitivity of urban pollution to the degree of city smartness in China both conceptually and empirically, we modify a theoretical model of classic land allocation decisions to demonstrate how local officials’ responsibilities to protect the ecological environment and promote economic growth can lead to the long-run spatial expansion of smart cities, resulting in the improvement of EEQ. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) analysis, we find that from 2005 to 2017 period, smart city initiatives in China reduced industrial exhaust gas and industrial wastewater by approximately 20.7% and 12.2%, respectively, such that most of the reduction may be attributed to the technology effect and allocation effect of urban innovation.}

Based on a media analysis on national and local scales, the paper shows that the smart city effect is an entangled phenomenon. Generally speaking, it consists of a lexical glue that holds together processes of data-driven neoliberalisation of urban governance. However, at municipal level we observe more variegated effects of reverse-scale policymaking, labelling and territorialisation where the smart city appears as a more-than-mobile but also as a more-than-local urban policy.}

The results show that SCPs have a positive effect on both economic and total ecological efficiency (incorporating resource consumption and pollution emissions). However, the environmental protection effect is not as strong as the resource-preserving effect. These results may be related to China's current stage of development.

This data is relayed to the Cloud for processing and analysis due to its large-scale infrastructural capabilities. However, the key goal of the drone deployment in smart city scenarios or urban environments is to provide timely and quick response alongside providing an energy-efficient service delivery. Thus, we need a sustainable solution that can be deployed locally (closer to the data source) in a smart city, to process or analyze the data (generated from smart city sources) and provide timely decision making for smart city applications. Edge computing, popularly known as the “cloud close to the ground”, can provide computational and processing facilities at edge of the network in a smart city. Hence, Edge computing act as an effective alternative solution to process and analyze the data closer to the point of it’s generation. Looking into the above discussion, We propose a novel drone-edge coalesce that provides an energy-aware data processing mechanism for sustainable service delivery in the multi-drone smart city networks. In this model, the edge computing layer is deployed to process and store the data sensed and collected by drones in a smart city. In this context, an adaptive edge node selection mechanism has been designed on the basis of decision tree approach. In this coalesce, we have to deal with the conventional problems related to the collision and congestion while providing low-latency and sustainable data transmission in a smart city. So, We have designed an energy-aware multi-purpose algorithm that avoids collisions and provides a congestion free data transmission. The proposed coalesce is validated in a simulated environment on the basis of several performance metrics such as, throughput, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.}

By applying this strategy, the amount of light and the energy consumption of LED light sources is restricted under conditions where no activity occurs in the environment or the level of the performed activity is limited. The results of system simulation and implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.

The collection of waste is important in smart city service and smart technology has great potential for increasing garbage collection efficiency and quality all around the world. This is a waste of resources since garbage is emptied even half-full, city resources are misused, and vehicle gas is wasted. High costs and poor effectiveness are the two main problems with smart city garbage collection. This problem can be solved by recycling since it reduces the garbage that has to be disposed of and protects valuable storage space. Although the recycling rates are rising, estimates predict that people can generate more waste than ever before. A key focus of machine learning is developing algorithms that can acquire and utilize information in the learning process to make future predictions. Therefore, this paper’s automatic machine learning-based waste recycling framework (AMLWRF) has been proposed to classify and separate materials in a mixed recycling application for improved separation of complicated waste. The major goal of this research is to examine machine learning algorithms utilized in recycling systems. This paper suggests the ML and Internet of Things (IoT) for smart waste management to overcome this problem in the smart city. The IoT-powered devices may be installed in waste containers including recycling bins and it gives real-time data on garbage generating behavior. Image processing may be used to calculate a dump’s garbage index. They offer a clear picture of trash and recycling trends and suggestions on improving productivity. This research compiles the most recent advances in recycling-related machine learning.}

The main benefit of CIDS relies on the information sharing process among devices, nodes, software and hardware entities. However, traditional CIDS often requires a trusted third partner, e.g., a centralized computing server, to help build up a trusted communication channel among various entities. Such requirement is not practical in real-world implementation, making the integrity of shared information compromised easily. With the wide adoption, blockchain technology has given a solution to protect the distributed/collaborative detection system. In the current market, blockchain technology has been extensively researched across many detection scenarios, but there is a need to explore how such technology can overall contribute to CIDS and a general distributed detection system. In this work, we introduce a blockchain-assisted security management framework for CIDS, which summarizes and provides an integrated protection given by blockchain. In the case study, we evaluate our proposed framework in both a simulated and a real CIDS setup with challenge-based mechanism. The results demonstrate the promising benefits provided by blockchain in CIDS.}

The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.}

We used a descriptive-analytical research methodology. According to our scoping review, urban form and everyday life have much in common. This study identified 13 factors in four categories to analyse the urban form of Egypt’s New Administrative Capital City, while ignoring lifestyle, since the city is still under construction. A framework for developing the singularity of capital cities is presented in our results, as a means of increasing the city’s singularity across its urban forms. By applying the four keys and the factors of singularity, this article concludes with a framework for enhancing the urban structure of smart cities. It was also suggested that the smart city concept could provide new directions for designing unique capital cities worldwide.}

These sensors increasingly include physiological and sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional states of urban citizens. In urban planning, emotional data has so far been conceptualised as ‘people as sensors’ where data is used to create an aggregated emotion layer for real-time urban planning. This paper argues this approach does not enable citizens any meaningful participation in urban planning. In contrast, this paper demonstrates what emotion can ‘do’ when citizen actively use emotions to participate in the problem framing in smart city governance. The paper offers a framework of smart city participation with emotion data by focusing on the Bio Mapping project, where physiological sensors are used as participatory mapping approach that led to urban planning. This approach enabled citizens to engage in a dialogue around their emotional response to urban space and articulate the potential for emotion data in urban governance. There needs to be a consideration of 1) multi-dimensional emotion data, 2) an active participant role, 3) extended participation within the planning process 4), and empowerment within urban governance. The paper argues that a participatory approach to emotion data can function as a dynamic leverage point of negotiation in smart city governance between citizens, urban space, and civic agencies.}

However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.}

However, data privacy becomes a real issue. This problem can be addressed by using federated learning trusted authority principle. In this paper, we investigate a novel federated deep learning approach to urban traffic flow forecasting that graph learning, and trusted authority mechanism. The road network is first pre-processed to eliminate the noise from the traffic data. Next, detecting anomalous features is performed to prune irrelevant edges and patterns. The generated graph is then utilized to learn a graph convolutional neural network for calculating the future city’s traffic flow. We extensive evaluate our federated learning-based framework, where a case study on predicting the future traffic flows has been carried out using multiple datasets. We examine it with different baseline techniques as well. The findings show that the suggested framework greatly outperforms the baseline methods, particularly when the graph has a lot of nodes. Importantly, our approach is the first one that integrates trusted authority principle in federated learning and, by doing so, it is able to efficiently secure model data. Moreover, the average precision of the developed model reached 84%, while the baseline solutions did not exceed 77%.}

A traffic flow prediction model is constructed based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm. The target road section and its historical traffic flow data in Tianjin are collected and pre-processed. Then, several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are stacked together to form a DBN, which is trained as a generative model. Finally, its performance is analyzed by the simulation experiment. The algorithm model proposed is compared with Neuro Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) model, Deep Learning Architecture (DLA), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The results show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the algorithm model proposed are 4.42%, 6.21%, and 8.03%, respectively. Its prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms. In addition, the algorithm can effectively suppress the spread of congestion in the smart city, achieving timely evacuation of traffic congestion. In short, the constructed Deep Learning-based traffic flow prediction model has a high-precision prediction effect and traffic congestion evacuation performance, which can provide experimental references for the later construction of smart cities.}

Short delays in communication between vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), smooth traffic flow, and road safety are the key challenges of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). The rapid upsurge in the number of road vehicles has increased traffic congestion and the number of road accidents. To fix this issue, Vehicular Networks (VNs) have developed many new ideas, including vehicular communications, navigation, and traffic control. Machine Learning (ML) is an efficient approach to finding hidden insights into ITS without being programmed explicitly by learning from data. This research proposed a fusion-based intelligent traffic congestion control system for VNs (FITCCS-VN) using ML techniques that collect traffic data and route traffic on available routes to alleviate traffic congestion in smart cities. The proposed system provides innovative services to the drivers that enable a view of traffic flow and the volume of vehicles available on the road remotely, intending to avoid traffic jams. The proposed model improves traffic flow and decreases congestion. The proposed system provides an accuracy of 95% and a miss rate of 5%, which is better than previous approaches.}

Moreover, more regulations and rules about protecting user data are being enforced worldwide. Compared with centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) provides a natural method to protect users' privacy by distributing learning over decentralized data and offers artificial intelligence advantages for sensitive, heterogeneous data domains. Researchers have recently implemented FL, motivated by the improvement in privacy and security of integrated systems in SC. However, many technological problems and risks have been identified. This study provides a comprehensive review of FL's application to improve privacy and security in SC systems (i.e., transportation, healthcare, communication, etc.). The benefits, drawbacks, open research issues and future directions of the implementation of FL in SC are thoroughly discussed. The study concluded that the existing FL systems required comprehensive testing for different types of attacks, further improving the data protection and performance in SC.}

There has been a continuous emphasis from the research community to predict air quality and manage traffic for congestion-free roads. This paper proposes a novel framework to identify traffic congestion and estimate air quality using crowdsourced information. Navigation Reference Spatial Data (NRSD) was created using the spatial likelihood method using GPS trajectories and OpenStreetMap. This NRSD was also used to design the traffic environment using distance, speed, and time interval mapping. After the NRSD creation, the framework used the real-time data of the registered user to compute the traffic density using the Graham scan with the k means algorithm. Eight standard air quality parameters were used to identify the air quality index of a particular node using a Bayesian Classifier. A case analysis was performed on the road network of three major cities of north India lying within a bounding box of (lat:30.518065, lon:76.659055) to (lat: 30.512501, lon:76.658808) was performed to validate the proposed framework. Based on the performed experiment, the proposed framework achieved maximum accuracy of 98 percent. Similarly, NSRD improves the framework's accuracy by 3.8% in comparison to the baseline dataset. In 87 percent of scenarios, this framework can also determine the shortest path by avoiding traffic.}

At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing the development of increasingly advanced solutions for real-time management of collected information related to the management and coexistence of vehicles (i.e., buses, cars, trains, bicycles, etc.) immersed in urban and sub-urban traffic. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35 percent in daily traffic reduction.}

Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}
