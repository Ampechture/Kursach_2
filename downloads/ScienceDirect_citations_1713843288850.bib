abstract = {Vanadium dioxide (VO2), a remarkably popular thermochromic material, has attracted considerable attention due to its unique reversible metal-insulator phase transition characteristic, which can be used in practical applications such as energy-saving smart windows. However, the advance on enhancing the visible light transmittance while obtaining a useable phase transition temperature remains unresolved issue. Herein, the atomic structures and electronic-optical properties of nRu+W-codoped (n =1–4) VO2 were investigated by the first-principles calculations. The results show that the nRu + W-codoped VO2 is thermally and mechanically stable. The desirable nRu + W co-doped VO2 can be easily prepared under V-rich conditions, and that some V atoms were replaced by Ru and W atoms in the codoping structures, with the [RuO6] and [WO6] octahedra cosharing an edge or oxygen atoms. Furthermore, a lower phase transition temperature and the near-infrared modulation capacity of VO2 could be obtained in theoretical calculations due to the synergistic effect of nRu+W codoping. That is, the introduction of Ru atoms could widen the optical band gap of VO2, increasing the luminous transmittance; Simultaneously, the Fermi levels for nRu+W configurations gradually entered one of the narrow bands, decreasing the electronic band gap and further reducing the phase transition temperature due to the incorporation of the W dopant, which donates extra electrons to the codoping systems due to its higher ion valence. The current work provides an approach for improving the thermochromic performance of VO2 films in energy-saving smart windows, thereby providing new insights into the relationship between overall performance improvement and structural variations induced by elements codoping.}

Such a procedure takes into account the characteristics and functioning conditions of the test TM. In such a context, the safety of the test TM in terms of the maximum generated overpressures and air entry prevention during transient tests is taken into account.}

abstract = {Passenger alighting estimation is a critical task in public transport (PT) management, especially for entry-only Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) transport systems where passenger alighting are not recorded. Effective estimation methods are necessary for trip analysis and route planning, offering valuable insights into passengers’ mobility patterns and, subsequently, improving the quality of service. However, the stochastic nature of passenger behaviour challenges the degree of successful alighting estimates. A classic approach to infer the alighting stops of passengers is the use of trip-chaining principles. Since these principles are dispersed across the literature in the field, their comprehensive review is pivotal to establish the best practice for alighting estimation. Still, trip-chaining approaches are unable to infer the alighting of non-commuting passengers. This paper addresses these two research gaps by: i) providing a critical overview of the existing principles and methods for alighting estimation; ii) proposing an approach to improve alighting estimation that consistently integrates the most effective state-of-the-art principles on trip-chaining; and iii) further introducing a frequent pattern mining and density-based clustering solutions to support alighting estimation for non-commuting passengers. Considering the public bus transport in Lisbon city as the guiding case study, the achieved estimation rate by the proposed assembled model is 92%. Moreover, the density-based clustering solution is found to improve the estimation of 11pp against classic trip-chaining principles. Furthermore, the proposed model and acquired results yield actionable value to enhance PT operations and services, ultimately leading to improved bus routing and quality of service.}

abstract = {Subsurface shallow gas has been widely discovered in coastal areas across continents at buried depths of approximately 10–100 m. Its presence poses a significant hazard and risk during underground construction, e.g., risk of explosion and fire when using tunnel boring machines for subway construction. Therefore, it is important to determine the spatial distribution of the shallow gas pressure during site investigation for subsequent hazard analysis and mitigation. In engineering practice, the gas pressure is often sparsely measured at a limited number of locations using modified cone penetration tests (CPTs) owing to time, budget, resource, and technical constraints. There are no rational or quantitative methods available for the planning of site investigation of gas pressure. Therefore, it is important to determine ways to properly and efficiently plan a site investigation of the shallow gas pressure during geotechnical site investigation (e.g., how to determine the required number of modified CPTs (i.e., the sample size) and their corresponding optimal locations). A smart sampling strategy is developed for planning of site investigation in this study that uses innovative data analytic methods (e.g., Bayesian compressive sampling, BCS, and information entropy) to automatically determine sample size and optimal sampling location for gas pressure characterization. The proposed smart sampling strategy is illustrated using numerical examples. The results show that the proposed smart sampling strategy performs reasonably well.}

The project deals with all the problems that appear inside city centres due to cargo trucks services or lorry door-to-door delivery. The authors of this paper posit the hypothesis that for the time being, the SmartFreight project is the best solution against congestion and environmentally harmful externalities in urban areas.

In this study, using data from the Energy Systems Catapult's Living Laboratory, we explore a fundamental energy service (heat) utilized in buildings from a novel angle: social conflict. We define social conflict as oppositional goals, aims, and values held by different people. We draw from three sets of primary data—diary studies and blogging via mobile ethnography, telephone interviews, and household interviews—involving 100 homes across Birmingham (West Midlands), Bridgend (Wales), Manchester (Greater Manchester), and Newcastle (Northumberland) in the United Kingdom. We identify five different forms of “thermal conflict”: parents versus children, hosts versus guests, roommates vs. each other, landlords vs. tenants, and couples vs. each other. After documenting the presence of 20 specific examples of conflict, we then discuss how they differ by location (intrinsic vs. extrinsic), type (preference, attitude, and variety) and values (hedonic, egoistic, altruistic, biospheric). We conclude with implications for energy and buildings research and policy more broadly, noting that thermal conflicts in the home differ in their location or cause. Moreover, thermal conflicts differ in their severity, with some occurring as more minor annoyances over preferences, but others relating attitudes, where heating actions or preferences become a proxy for something else, and emit strong feelings about how household members view another person as lazy, careless or wasteful. A variety of values remain attached to heating conflicts, with hedonic (self-comfort, self-pleasure), egoistic (saving money, control) and altruistic (helping others, making others comfortable) values almost evenly reflected across our examples.}

These systems can be developed with sensor node platform which can detect and communicate. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consists of these sensor nodes containing simple processors, low power consuming antennas and various detectors. As the sensor networks do not require wired communication infrastructure, they can easily and inexpensively be formed with no harm to the environment. The sensor nodes have the ability to store and process data locally thanks to the software and hardware structure they have. The fact that they can get in contact with each other enables them to collaborate in performing complicated tasks along with exchanging information. As the communication means have low power consumption, it ensures that the life of the sensor nodes is long. The fact, too, that the nodes are programmable after being placed in the medium provides greater advantages. Because of the low cost and flexibility in use, the wireless sensor nodes are convenient to be used in many industrial and environmental applications. In this study, -how to develop smart environment, smart agriculture, smart grid with WSN- is analyzed.}

However, most of developing nations are currently investigating potentials of some pilot projects or few research works. In this article, the applied activities in developing countries for smart grid are reviewed and categorized into two major groups: group of pioneer developing countries in smart grid and other developing countries are placed in another group. The findings demonstrate that a few countries such as China, India and Brazil have had proper planning and development in this technology. In some cases like China, the efforts are considered comparable with developed nations like U.S. Therefore, according to the development progress for smart grid in China, India and Brazil, a pattern of reference for other developing countries is suggested.}

Such a mechanism is built into a smart meter (SM) and aims to reduce the amount of data sent to an electric power company (EPC). Additionally, this mechanism makes use of curve adjustment to find, in an adaptive way in run time, a functional model, among the available options, that best adapts to the consumption measures inferred by the SM. The experiments present compression rates where the data recovered by the functional model respect a pre-established error threshold. Thus, allowing the scalability of DSM applications in this infrastructure. Therefore, it can to be stated that the presence of the data compression mechanism proposed in this work is satisfactorily adequate for the DSM scenario of consumption and distributed generation achieving compression rates close to 96%, as well as provides the possibility of being adapted to other contexts, such as WSN.}

Our simulation results show that by increasing the battery capacity of the drones, the drones’ visibility range would also increase and thus, the number of drones would be reduced. Moreover, when the targets are sparsely distributed across a large number of different regions, a further increase to the targets does not require an increase in the number of drones needed to monitor them.}

Illustrating the dynamics of non-agenda-setting, this study reviews the electricity sector in the Canadian province of Quebec. Drawing from Kingdon's multiple streams, we argue that the opening of a policy window that would put smart grid development on the policy agenda has proved elusive. In the problem stream, we show that key actors in Quebec's electricity sector do not link smart grid development to policy problems such as climate change or sustainability. In contrast to other jurisdictions, abundant renewable electricity removes the pressure to substitute fossil with renewable energy and the need for its integration via smart grid. In the policy stream, we show that despite the presence of different ideas about smart grid among experts, the state-owned electric utility dominates the policy monopoly and frames smart grid as a technological fix to upgrade the grid. In the political stream, we observe that the issue has very low salience. Based on media analysis, we show that the public mood is somewhat negative and focuses mostly on the health impacts of smart meters. Another factor is the lack of political entrepreneurs emerging either for or against smart grid deployment. As the three streams do not converge and no policy entrepreneur promotes a broad vision of smart grid that would require fundamental changes in the electricity sector, this review concludes that smart grid in Quebec has developed primarily in the form of a technological, security-focused upgrade.}

The main goal of this mechanism is to provide fairness in the access to the network, thus avoiding that some network nodes monopolize the use of the channels due to their higher traffic generation rate, or to their geographical position. Besides, different priorities have been considered for the traffic flows transmitted by different applications. The goal here is to provide the needed Quality of Service (QoS) to all traffic flows, especially when the traffic load is high. The proposal is evaluated in the context of a wireless ad hoc network composed by a set of smart grid meter devices. Applying our proposed congestion control mechanism leads to performance improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, network throughput fairness between different traffic sources, packet network transit time and QoS provision.}

abstract = {A water supply system that integrates water source management, treatment and distribution is a critical infrastructure in urban areas. Traditional water quality research mostly focused on separate aspects, lacking a comprehensive coverage of all aspects, which undermines the prediction accuracies. In this paper, we propose a smart data analysis scheme to analyze and predict the water quality, considering all the water quality standard indicators. Instead of data output from water treatment, we collect the raw water data directly from water sources. We design two models to predict the water quality: (1) adaptive learning rate BP neural network (ALBP) and (2) 2-step isolation and random forest (2sIRF). We applied these models in the practical urban water supply systems of Oslo and Bergen in Norway. The results show that ALBP is theoretically simple and easy to implement. 2sIRF considers the risk distribution and shows higher prediction accuracy. In addition, we perform the correlation analysis of all the indicators and the importance analysis over different indicators. The domain experts have confirmed that this work is meaningful for future risk control and decision support in urban water supply systems.}

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion on the Ti-based materials, which can lead to microbial corrosion, pipe blockage, transplant infection and other problems, has attracted considerable attention. Developing superhydrophobic TiO2/Ti composite surface with release-killing and photocatalytic bactericidal performances has been confirmed to be an effective strategy for preventing bacterial adhesion. However, there are certain limitations, such as efficient bactericidal performance only for UV photocatalytic but low efficiency for solar light, and superhydrophobic surface not conducive to release-killing. Herein, a smart bacterial anti-adhesive Ti-based surface with switchable hydrophobicity–hydrophilicity is used to prevent the adhesion of two model bacteria: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti endows it with hydrophobicity–hydrophilicity switch under ultraviolet radiation. Moreover, decoration with Ag/AgCl nanoparticles (NPs) promotes the solar light photocatalytic release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), greatly improving the bactericidal performance. The experimental results and the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed that the superhydrophilic surface is more conducive to release-killing compared to the superhydrophobic one. The hydration layer formed endows it with excellent bacterial anti-adhesion. The superhydrophobic surface in a Cassie–Baxter state exhibits additional prominent bacterial anti-adhesion than a superhydrophilic one because of the air layer and low adhesive force. This new material confirmed to be chemical and abrasion resistant, maintaining its excellent performances after cyclic testing. The strategy of designing a solar light photocatalytic bactericidal and constructing bacterial anti-adhesive smart surfaces with switchable wettability opens up a new avenue for research on bacterial anti-adhesion.}

In this paper, we study the detection of an abnormal change in a monitored variable through crowd sensed and heterogeneous data, where the change is suggestive of an emergency situation. We formulate our problem as a sequential change-point detection problem, where the underlying distribution of the variable changes at an unknown time. We aim to detect the change-point with minimal delay, subject to a false alarm constraint. We utilize Shiryaev’s test to construct two variants of the solution depending on the structure of the received data contributions and mobility of participating sensing elements. We conduct simulations experiments to show the performance of these variants in terms of the delay-false alarm trade-off in different scenarios.}

A macroscopic view of smart energy (SE) and smart built environment (SBE) is provided in this paper. Categories of smart energy systems (SESs) are divided according to the trade forms. Objectives of SBE include minimizing non-renewable energy to maintain sustainable BE, minimizing carbon exhausted to guarantee green BE, and minimizing capital cost to provide economically affordable BE. The transient fraction of power (FP) in SESs has to be controlled to obtain the optimal fraction of energy (FE). The optimal FE values depend not only on system size and time scales but also on SBE objectives. A weighted maximum volume criterion is proposed to take sustainability, green, and affordability into account. Results are compared with those optimization results based on a single objective. Methodologies for promotion of SESs from technology, system optimization, demand forecasting, and holistic design views are presented. The corresponding solution for SBE is illustrated.

The concepts of Markov game and best response dynamics are heavily leveraged. Our aim is to make the framework conceptually sound and computationally practical for a range of realistic applications, including micro path planning for autonomous vehicles. To this end, we first convert the would-be stochastic game problem into a closely related deterministic one by introducing risk premium in the utility function for each individual agent. We show how the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the simplified deterministic game can be solved by an algorithm based on best response dynamics. In order to better model human driving behaviors with bounded rationality, we seek to further simplify the solution concept by replacing the Nash equilibrium condition with a heuristic and adaptive optimization with finite look-ahead anticipation. In addition, the algorithm corresponding to the new solution concept drastically improves the computational efficiency. To demonstrate how our approach can be applied to realistic traffic settings, we conduct a simulation experiment: to derive merging and yielding behaviors on a double-lane highway with an unexpected barrier. Despite assumption differences involved in the two solution concepts, the derived numerical solutions show that the endogenized driving behaviors are very similar. We also briefly comment on how the proposed framework can be further extended in a number of directions in our forthcoming work, such as behavioral calibration using real traffic video data, and computational mechanism design for traffic policy optimization.}

To further strengthen this collaboration, Hyperledger Fabric (HF) can be prominently considered as a mean to implement next-generation secure and intelligent communication. However, implementing real-world applications on this platform may concern performance issues. For the constructive exploration of these issues, initially, we design a novel P2P energy trading framework for improving resource utilization and consequently addressing the impending electricity crisis challenge. Thenceforward, we evaluate the results based on the different system operational parameters for establishing a proof-of-concept. For determining performance bottlenecks and best-configuration, these results are investigated independently by using the Nectar Research Cloud, thereby sustaining scalability. The proposed evaluation approach will largely contribute to determining the system operational-level parameters of enterprise applications that will utilize the HF platform as their communication tool-support. In addition, a benchmark is presented based on the Hyperledger Caliper tool to facilitate application designers and developers in the form of selecting an appropriate implementation model across the two latest stable HF model versions. The illustrative CPS-enabled energy trading scenario corroborates the feasibility of the proposed framework to foster the development of HF-assisted smart P2P energy trading mechanisms.}

Temperature distributions through wall configurations with and without W doped VO2 were calculated using finite differences method implemented in Matlab environment. Calculations take into consideration dynamic variations of W doped VO2 absorptivity depending on outdoor temperature variations. Decrement factor, time lag, transmission and peak loads of cooling and heating were calculated. Results have shown that the indoor surface temperature is attenuated during summer by 2–3 °C depending on orientation. Cooling energy saving due to the use of W doped VO2 in summer is around 70% monthly which is equivalent to save $21.6/month of electricity invoiced amount. During winter, W doped VO2 maintains the same value of absorptivity as the uninsulated wall. Thus, results show small differences for indoor surface temperature and heating energy consumption. The application of W doped VO2 in intelligent thermal wall insulation offers a real-time dynamic variation of building’s envelope solar absorptivity and makes smart walls concept more feasible.}

By employing the Difference-in-difference strategy, this study examines the effect of the NEDC policy on air pollution mitigation with Chinese prefecture-level city data. The results reveal that the NEDC policy can significantly lead to a 0.13-unit drop in SO2 emissions. The NEDC policy curbs pollution by stimulating green investments, promoting green technology innovation, advancing resource allocation efficiency, and reducing energy consumption. The effect of the NEDC policy appears to be heterogeneous under different conditions. Furthermore, this phenomenon is more conspicuous in prefectures led by older officials, where the age incentives nearing the promotion golden age threshold amplify the effects of air pollution mitigation, while those nearing retirement years exacerbate such effects. Notably, the interaction effect between environmental regulations and the NEDC policy on air pollution mitigation is elucidated. Moreover, positive spatial spillover effects extending to neighboring regions are identified, underscoring the imperative of regional collaboration and technological diffusion. Based on the findings above, several policy implications are proposed.}

abstract = {Although the research in triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) textiles has seen a rapid development recently, their integrated and mass fabrication process is still challenging, which hinders its further applications for wearable sensors. Herein, highly integrated and scalable manufacturing conductive composite fibers for weaving TENGs are presented, which might overcome the major problems. The fibers possess liquid alloy/silicone rubber core/shell structures made by simultaneously injecting liquid alloy and silicone rubber into the separate input ports of a coaxial needle, followed by automatically assembled from the output. The liquid alloy/silicone rubber core/shell fiber (LCF) has both good pliability and high resistance-strain sensitivity, which is beneficial for serving as strain sensors directly, and for incorporating with woven for textile-TENGs (t-TENGs)-based self-powered sensoring application. As a result, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), short-circuit transferred charge (Qsc) and maximum power density of 4 × 4 cm2 t-TENG are 175 V, 15 μA, 66 nC and 469 mW/m2, respectively. Additionally, the t-TENG is mechanically robust, chemically stable and easy-cleaning for daily use. The wearable t-TENG devices can be used to detect human motions. This work provides a novel method of scalable manufacturing LCFs for weaving wearable t-TENGs, contributing to the development of t-TENGs and wearable self-powered sensors.}

Marshaling data from fifty-two key informant interviews and extensive document analysis, we analyze the institutional and organizational processes that are driving the deployment of smart meters. Combining work on institutional logics with innovation literature, we argue that nested logics create specific constraints and opportunities that condition the emergence of new organizational forms and behaviors. We discuss the implications of this analysis for energy research and sustainability policy.}

The challenge lies in accommodating multiple application microservices with varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to share the sensing infrastructure for better resource utilization. In this work, we propose a novel data collection framework, CaDGen (Context-aware Data Generation) for such a shared IoT infrastructure that enables integrated data filtration and forwarding towards minimizing the resource consumption footprint for the IoT infrastructure. The proposed filtration mechanism utilizes the contextual information associated with the running application for determining the relevance of the data. Whereas the proposed forwarding policy aims to satisfy the diverse QoS requirements for the running applications by selecting the suitable next-hop forwarder based on the microservices distribution across different edge devices. A thorough performance evaluation of CaDGen through a testbed implementation as well as a simulation study for diverse setups reveals promising results concerning network resource utilization, scalability, energy conservation, and distribution of computation for optimal service provisioning. It is observed that the CaDGen can achieve nearly 35% reduction in the generated data for a moderately dynamic scenario without compromising on the data quality.}

Incorporating these algorithms into the electronic health record and clinical workflows will therefore be critical for unlocking these algorithms’ potential. This review summarizes the current state of predictive algorithms in spine surgery and proposes a way forward for optimally integrating them into clinical care. The proposed improvements could also be translated to other subspecialties in orthopedics and neurosurgery.}

To consider the energy revolution proposition, this paper presents findings from a Policy Delphi survey of interdisciplinary energy researchers and stakeholders (n = 113) on alternative transition paths (disruptive or continuity-led) for the UK energy system. The paper includes quantitative and qualitative survey findings on a number of social and technical aspects of the energy revolution proposition: system governance, security and flexibility arrangements, power sector decarbonisation, the future of large supply firms and energy policy priorities. The results suggest that rather than a wholesale revolution the UK's energy transition over the next two decades will involve a mix of disruptive and continuity-led elements. Experts differ on a number of issues associated with the energy revolution proposition, including the impact of demand side response on whole system flexibility and whether energy systems are best governed at a local or national scale. However, rather than having fixed orientations to either disruption or continuity-led change, most experts respond on an issue-by-issue basis. The energy revolution proposition is socially constructed and contestable, and whole energy systems policy and research should go beyond uniform transition narratives.}

Due to the extreme operational requirements, the conventional gyros are not able to provide roll angle estimation in the absence of initial values post launch phase due to sensor saturation. This paper describes two alternate methods for roll angle estimation using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). A flight dynamics model and GNSS measurements based on open source simulation software are used to provide a comparative analysis of two methods based on using single and double antennas. A projectile simulation estimates the position, velocity and attitude of a projectile when it is launched with the given launch conditions. Similarly, the satellite simulation estimates the position and orbit of satellites provided the orbital parameters. These simulations are used in validation of these alternate methods. The simulation results show that single antenna method is more accurate than the double antenna method, however a choice has to be made based on the operational requirements.}

In Part II, the local-scale approach enabled to compare the areas most affected by COVID-19 with those impacted by climate change. There are large uncertainties around financial support from the federal government and their impact at local scale. São Paulo city was chosen because it reveals some important aspects of spatial structure carried out through local investments. In this sense, updated information on floods and warmer surfaces were updated to provoke a discussion about a potential confluence with the effects of pandemic. The results highlighted the effects of scarce federal transfers and the maps help us to identify the spatial distribution of people at risk, which can be beneficial for municipal decisions as they highlight a significative relationship between pandemic effects and an uneven social structure. In conclusion, the trade-off between this unequal structure and a necessary and effectively sustainable change leads us to reflect on local investment trends.}

On this basis, we present two different examples regarding the scale of the RMs. The presentation of these models aims to assess the suitability for Smart Cities and open data and to indicate the need for their adaptation not only to developing processes (system design) but also to management processes (involvement of stakeholders in the design process of these systems). The use of RMs and AEP systems is necessary for demonstrating the complex processes of producing IoT systems. This is an area of knowledge that also shows how to develop open data, especially in the context of two processes: crowdsourcing and crowdsensing.

abstract = {This paper makes a critical contribution to the discussion about the transition from an automobile society to a multimodal society in Western transport and mobility research, which is characterised by a flexible use of different transport options. This discussion is fuelled, in particular, by the emergence of smart mobility, in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) – e.g., the smartphone – are used to switch flexibly between new interconnected mobility services (such as carsharing, ridesharing, bikesharing, bus or train). The starting point for the scepticism towards this transition is the research on transport poverty, which problematizes social exclusions from participation in mobility due to the unequal distribution of mode options. This paper suggests a change of perspective from the real mode choice to potential/optional mode choice in order to account for this scepticism in the research on multimodal behaviours. Multioptionality is conceptualised as a necessary precondition for multimodal behaviours to achieve this change of perspective. Based on this conceptualisation, three theses result from a quantitative analysis of a data set from an area in the Rhine-Main region in Germany. The theses challenge the often-postulated potential ubiquity of multimodal behaviours: (i) Transport poverty – represented by a lack of mode options – inhibits the potential production of multimodal behaviours, particularly by socially marginalised people (low income, low education, precarious job situation, etc.). (ii) A multimodal divide describes the reproduction of transport poverty in the guise of modernisation, as the transport poor – with few mode options – also lack certain ICTs that provide central access media to smart mobility. (iii) Another (perfidious) form of social exclusion from participation in smart mobility concerns critical thinkers who avoid installing mobility applications to protect their privacy. This exclusion occurs because these apps do not have an alternative as access software to smart mobility.}

abstract = {In recent years, the terms “Smart Energy” and “Smart Energy Systems” have been used to express an approach that reaches broader than the term “Smart grid”. Where Smart Grids focus primarily on the electricity sector, Smart Energy Systems take an integrated holistic focus on the inclusion of more sectors (electricity, heating, cooling, industry, buildings and transportation) and allows for the identification of more achievable and affordable solutions to the transformation into future renewable and sustainable energy solutions. This paper first makes a review of the scientific literature within the field. Thereafter it discusses the term Smart Energy Systems with regard to the issues of definition, identification of solutions, modelling, and integration of storage. The conclusion is that the Smart Energy System concept represents a scientific shift in paradigms away from single-sector thinking to a coherent energy systems understanding on how to benefit from the integration of all sectors and infrastructures.}

Drawing from innovation and critical mass theories, and using merchant and consumer data, we provide explanations for the trial’s failure.

We employed a distributed system operator (DSO) as a supervisory layer for energy trading and dynamic power balance ensuring. Along with the local controller as a lower layer for tracking a reference trajectory from the upper layer, we developed an online algorithm with a hierarchical structure to solve the energy dispatching problem within dual-level optimization, offering an environmental-friendly control solution, due to reduction of fuel consumption. Finally, simulation results are presented to witness the advantages of our distributed algorithm approach in comparison to a noncooperative strategy.}

In this study, a smart silencing unit was designed based on the universal design principles to mitigate the noise pollution of a substation. The corresponding large noise reduction coefficient (NRC), smart selective absorption characteristics at certain frequency bands, and a beneficial low-frequency sound absorption effect were verified through impedance tube and reverberation room tests. A comparison of the analysis results showed that after the installation of the smart silencing units, the average steady state maximal sound pressure level (SPL) acting on the surrounding community building surfaces decreased by 10.77 dB. Thus the substation audible noise impact of the substation on the ambient environment was properly limited. This innovative solution bridges the gaps between the acoustic absorption and insulation theory research field and the implementation of noise suppressing measures for an acoustic environment friendly substation. Consequently, a cleaner power supply and soundscape compatibility between the substation and surrounding communities can be achieved more readily.}

The hybrid system is accompanied by a battery energy storage system to act as a backup source in case that the loads exceed the power produced from the three sources. The SEMS is implemented on Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE6 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) board using QUARTUS II software and LABVIEW. FPGAs are highly flexible and reprogrammable logic devices. Analog to digital converter (ADC) is used to interface the current and voltage of the three sources with FPGA. As a result of the weather fluctuations, the voltage of the three sources is not stable. Therefore, the voltage of the three sources is adjusted using the Buck-Boost converter technology, which is set at 24 V until the merging process takes place. The results prove the high efficiency of the FPGA and its high response to the load changes.}

abstract = {Smart control access to any service is at the very basis of any smart project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for service access control an any smart system, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics cannot be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission method between the medias, for which the users require access and the servers, wherein the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, we use smart cards as an effective yet efficient solution to this critical data storage problem. Furthermore, fingerprints have been used as a human identifier for some time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet perfectly stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of fingerprint verification on smart cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner’s card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. The proposed implementation is based on the Skin Elasticity Tolerant Algorithm (SETA), which uses minutiae to implement fingerprints matching. It consists of finding the best alignment between the compared fingerprints before proceeding with the comparison step to maximize the score that quantifies the quality of the matching. Although efficient, SETA is not suitable for card implementation because it requires a lot of dynamic storage memory to store the counters of all possible rotations and translations. In order to make the implementation on smart cards viable mitigating the problem of the volume of storage required to store the translations and rotations, we subdivide the search space into small subspaces. Thus, only the translations and rotations that fall within to the handled subspace at each instant are considered. The implementation on smart cards is evaluated for known fingerprint datasets. Several settings are tested, establishing that the implementation is suitable for real-time applications.}

This control method is used as an Energy Cooperative Approach (ECA) to manage the power flow between a PV and battery-fed smart grid within a DC micro-grid, supplying some connected houses. In fact, using an ECA which is based on photovoltaic (PV) power transfer between three houses, connected to the AC network; through a DC micro-grid, the photovoltaic energy can be effectively used to satisfy the load demand. Such a process ensures a continuous demand satisfaction, lengthens the storage system life time by minimizing the resort of the battery, and alleviates the stress of the main grid minimizing the consumption of electricity fed by the AC grid. In fact, this strategy increases the system efficiency and the power supply quality. To achieve such purposes, a control algorithm for distributed flexible network residential PV systems was properly developed. The decision criterion for the developed supervisor is based on the instantaneous PV power, the required power, and the battery state of charge in order to manage the power flow under six operating modes. The control strategy was proposed also to regulate DC bus voltage and maintain the power balance within the micro-grid. The simulation results validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy under various conditions. To highlight this strategy benefits, a comparative study between strategies without and with ECA was performed. The results of this study showed that using the ECA on a typical day, the energy PV contribution to satisfy the loads (Fpv) grows by a rate that varies from 15.5% to 23.45%, the battery contribution part (Fbat) recorded a decrease that varied between 8.77% and 18.42%, while the main grid contribution (Fgrid) was reduced by a rate that varied between 2.41% and 13.1%.}

Therefore, local authorities face the challenge of making urban freight transport sustainable. To do so, it is necessary to involve the various stakeholder groups of the city logistics ecosystem in ongoing sustainability efforts. This problem formed the basis for our formulated objective of this article, which is to analyse the roles of stakeholders in freight transport sustainability in the city logistics ecosystem. For the purpose of the objective thus formulated, in the article, we identified the roles of stakeholders in balancing freight transport. In addition, we have identified the freight transport balancing tasks in the city logistics ecosystem in which the stakeholders assigned to each identified role should be involved. The methodology we adopted for identifying stakeholder roles and assigning them to tasks in the city logistics ecosystem is universal. In the stakeholder analysis, we used expert research, where we first identified 16 stakeholder roles adopted in balancing freight transport in the city logistics ecosystem. We assigned these roles to the eight identified tasks in the city logistics ecosystem. To verify the adopted methodology, we conducted research in Polish cities. As part of them, we identified a group of 20 stakeholders (out of 30 considered) who perform 10 out of 16 roles (six roles were not identified in Polish cities). It is unfortunate that for Polish cities we did not identify any stakeholders performing the role of freight transport balancing leader. The recommendation for Polish city authorities is to include the 20 identified stakeholder groups in the individual identified freight balancing tasks in the city logistics ecosystem.}

Over the years, hypertension has become a high incident disease and it is continuing to threaten human health seriously. Unfortunately, no effective way has been found to cure hypertension at present. Many medical experiences have demonstrated the curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine in the hypertension treatment. In this paper, we explore smart Chinese medicine for hypertension treatment by combining deep learning and the traditional Chinese medicine theory. First, we present a potential idea to categorize the clinical cases into different groups based on symptom with the stacked auto-encoder model. Furthermore, we discuss and summarize the curative effect of classical prescriptions and herbs for each type of symptom in hypertension. Finally, we review the related work about deep learning models in medical application. The explored smart Chinese medicine is expected to guide doctors to treat hypertension diseases in clinical, which is helpful to build smart world, especially smart health.}

One of the smart grid purposes is to integrate a growing share of renewable generation while efficiently accommodating their variability and limited predictability through the actuation of consumer flexibility. Hence, the success of energy programs relies on customer involvement in altering their energy consumption through the use of analytics and incentive-based demand-side management. The rollout of smart meters throughout Europe should provide the necessary information to implement them. This is without accounting for a possible backlash of customers in response to bad practices of utilities when it comes to digitization and smart meter rollout, also associated with the potential distrust of digital products. Beyond legal binds and technical obstacles, the possible ways of handling the rollout of smart meters and metering, which defines the relationship between customers and utilities, are multiple. However, only the practices that exhibit ethical behavior of the utilities towards customers, and consider them as stakeholders in smart grids will lead to a fruitful and long-lasting relationship between customers and utilities.}

In this paper, the monthly usage (revealed usage) of smart card data was traced back from October 2011 to February 2017; on the other side, the usage survey was distributed in early 2017 to the targeting users (monitors) to obtain their “stated usage” over time. We found that the, from the smart card data, observed long-term usage dynamics are fairly in line with their chosen pattern, though biased to more recent observations. Further, regression analysis of individual patterns suggests the trend of “actual usage” can be explained with the chosen pattern (stated usage). This suggests that obtaining pattern information can be simple way for analysts to classify users and potentially predict their future demand.}

These instructions define a Turing complete language and are often represented by using a readable format that is referred to as opcodes. Here, we present a novel, more comprehensive, study that aims at gaining a precise understanding on how programmers use the linguistic instructions supported by Ethereum. More precisely, the contracts’ source code has been also analysed, in order to understand the high-level control structures and core instructions that are used for smart contract definitions, and how they are reflected on the opcode level. We have gathered ten of thousands of verified Ethereum smart contracts that have been written by using the Solidity language. This study can lay the groundwork for defining new formalisms and new domain specific languages (DSL). These can support the users in the development of decentralised applications (DAPPs).}

In this connection, our study evaluates a number of “what-if scenarios” of “city pruning” by means of realistic, agent-based computer simulations. They regard traffic restrictions for Barcelona with the purpose to identify the impact on travel performance and the environment. Positive counterintuitive effects related to Braess and Daganzo paradoxes are found in new alternatives to the street repurposing plans developed by the City of Barcelona. These result in a reduction of emissions (−8% of main pollutants) and traffic congestion (−14% of travel time) solely by closing some streets to motor vehicles. These findings indicate a formerly unnoticed potential to further improve the quality of urban life. Hence, the use of interactive urban models can be a powerful tool to explore and co-create policies within participatory approaches in spatial planning. Positive counterintuitive effects of street repurposing and network dismantling provide opportunities for participatory and sustainable city-making beyond the ongoing public debate.}

In Brazil, which is territorially large and contains a power distribution system with centralised generation, the deployment of smart grids tends to be time-consuming and could require decades to complete, as well as a large monetary investment. Therefore, the elaboration and implementation of well-defined criteria are necessary for the planning steps of this deployment to minimise the investment cost. This article aims to develop a methodology for selecting electrical systems that will be implemented in smart grids in Brazil by applying the Delphi method based on technical, financial and human resources and environmental applications. This methodology will be used to evaluate electrical systems in their current operating conditions. The results obtained in this research are the creation of a priority factor to determine the order of Smart grid deployment to achieve the best cost benefit in electrical systems evaluated.}

Structural equation models were then performed to test the effect of sociodemographic variables. This paper aims to evaluate whether vegetated vacant lots in a historic urban fabric are perceived as an asset or liability by visitors and to assess the prospects for a publicly-accepted reuse of such spaces in a shrinking Central European city. Results indicate that the selected lots are perceived ambivalently. Older visitors show a more positive perception of the vacant lots, while no significant gender differences were identified. Educated respondents visited the vegetated vacant lots less often and perceived them more negatively compared to their less educated counterparts. Policy implications are provided in the end.}

Starting from the idea that campuses may be regarded as small scale models of cities, a quantitative method for estimating to which extent the adoption of a given set of interventions by a municipality could contribute to make such city close to a nearly zero energy profile is proposed. To accomplish this task, the study considers the low carbon transition path of the campus of the University of Palermo and applies a simple method that, implementing an idea firstly developed by Yoshida et al. (2017), provides a rapid and effective graphical representation of the level of the success reached by the campus in terms of accomplishment of the nearly zero energy targets. The analysis of the transferability of such method to cities has shown that it can also be easily adopted by a city's administration and can be used for assessing the effectiveness of actions typically belonging to a city's energy policy, such as the public procurement and the waste management, apart from the actions regarding the public transportation system and the energy efficiency of the public building stock.}

First, we describe an efficient biometric-based anonymous credential scheme, which supports selective disclosure, suspension/thaw and revocation of credentials/entities. Our system provides non-transferability through a freshly computed hidden biometric attribute, which is generated using a secure fuzzy extractor during each authentication. This mechanism combined with offchain storage guarantees GDPR compliance, which is required for protecting user’s data. We define blinded (Brands) DLRep scheme to provide multi-show unlinkability, which is a lacking feature in Brands’ credential based systems. For larger organizations, we re-design the system by replacing the Merkle Tree with an accumulator to improve scalability. The new system enables auditing by adapting the standard Industrial IoT (IIoT) Identity Management Lifecycle to Blockchain. Finally, we show that the new proposal outperforms BASS, i.e. the most recent blockchain-based anonymous credential scheme designed for smart industry. The computational cost at the user-side (can be a weak IoT device) of our scheme is 8-times less than that of BASS. Thus, our system is more suitable for IIoT.}

A significant trend is that cyber and physical environments are being unprecedentedly entangled with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has been widely immersed into various domains in the industry. Among those areas where IoT would make significant impacts are building construction, operation, and management by facilitating high-class services, providing efficient functionalities, and moving towards sustainable development goals. So far, IoT itself has entered an ambiguous phase for industrial utilization, and there are limited number of studies focusing on the application of IoT in the building industry. Given the promising future impact of IoT technologies on buildings, and the increasing interests in interdisciplinary research among academics, this paper investigates the state-of-the-art projects and adoptions of IoT for the development of smart buildings within both academia and industry contexts. The wide-ranging IoT concepts are provided, covering the necessary breadth as well as relevant topic depth that directly relates to smart buildings. Current enabling technologies of IoT, especially those applied to buildings and related areas are summarized, which encompasses three different layers based on the conventional IoT architecture. Afterwards, several recent applications of IoT technologies on buildings towards the critical goals of smart buildings are selected and presented. Finally, the priorities and challenges of successful and seamless IoT integration for smart buildings are discussed. Besides, this paper discusses the future research questions to advance the implementation of IoT technologies in both building construction and operation phases. The paper argues that a mature adoption of IoT technologies in the building industry is not yet realized and, therefore, calls for more attention from researchers in the relevant fields from the application perspective.}

To fabricate this structure, namely, H2:TiO2/WO3@Pt, soft templating and hydrogen treatment approaches were selected to enhance the performance of TiO2/WO3 photocatalyst, together with the addition of Pt plasmonic nanoparticles. The coating can be photochemically charged in the presence of sacrificial electron donors and keep its stability, benefiting from the remained electrons stock for over 10 h to clean the surface from aggressive pollution also at night, in absence of light. This transparent heterostructure with high surface area, proper interfacial contacts in TiO2/WO3@Pt system, and extended visible light absorption resulting from the synergistic interactions of the composite system (TiO2, WO3, and Pt) presents an efficient self-cleaning performance. The smart coated surface could clean the substrate benefiting from 70% pollutants photodegradation after irradiation followed by dark storage (2 and 6 h, individually), and superhydrophilic properties were maintained for hours in the dark, thanks to oxygen vacancies resulted from hydrogen treatment.}

However, many scholars emphasize the vital role of civic consciousness and collective intelligence (CI) in addressing chronic issues and global crises related to shared interests and values. To achieve this with effective participatory design and planning (PD&P) processes, it's essential to understand citizens' perspectives rather than imposing ‘one-size-fits-all’ approaches. We explored how citizens evaluate existing PD&P mechanisms in three capital cities: Ankara, Bogota, and Madrid, representing developed, developing, and least-developed countries. Through collective experiments using conjoint analysis, we conducted citizen interviews based on the CI genome consisting of key dimensions and attributes of PD&P for public spaces. Crowdsourcing applications were integrated to enhance field studies. Additionally, chord diagrams and scatter charts visually depict interrelations among the grouped and ranked genome attributes. Our analysis explores variations and commonalities across cities and includes reflections from students. The results show that PD&P is perceived as significantly important, while top-down political decisions are perceived as dissatisfactory by most respondents. Notably, Madrid stands out positively in certain dimensions, including the willingness for active participation, multi-functionality as a capital, and diversity of initiatives. In addition, the political culture, respondents' education, age, and attachment to the city have significant influences on preferred methods, prioritized issues, and attitudes. Despite its limitations, conjoint analysis holds promise as a method to understand citizens' demands and design robust PD&P settings for deeper and broader involvement.}

abstract = {Accurate individual household load forecasting is essential for effectively managing energy demand and promoting efficient energy consumption. This study evaluates the performance of various deep learning models for individual household load forecasting, specifically using the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) dataset. Feature engineering is conducted, producing two distinct sets of features, and the models’ accuracy in predicting individual household loads is assessed using both basic and derived feature sets. The results demonstrate that the T2VBiLSTM model outperforms other models, achieving an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 74.90% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.433 kW. The incorporation of a wider range of features, including maximum load, minimum load, and load range over time, is emphasized to enhance forecasting accuracy. These features capture long-term load behavior, enabling the models to comprehend complex energy consumption patterns and generate more accurate and reliable predictions. Moreover, limitations in using MAPE as a loss function for load forecasting at the individual customer level are revealed, due to its sensitivity to scale, asymmetry, outliers, and uniform weighting assumption. Alternative loss functions like mean absolute error (MAE) are recommended, as they treat all errors equally and better capture data peaks. While this study focuses on the SGSC dataset, the findings have broader implications for efficiently managing energy demand and promoting energy consumption on a larger scale.}

abstract = {The socio-technical approach to innovation is used to show that the future of urban mobility will depend on the competition between coalitions of innovative actors who support alternative transport systems. A new graphical tool—the socio-technical map—is introduced in order to represent the positioning of supporting coalitions with reference to three variables: business models, propulsion technologies and power. Three transition pathways to 2030 may emerge from the current situation of urban mobility: 1) ‘AUTO-city’, i.e. the reconfiguration of the ‘individual car’ dominant system through the stable integration of producers of batteries; 2) ‘ECO-city’, i.e. the further empowering and diffusion of local coalitions which already integrate all non-car modes of transport; 3) ‘ELECTRI-city’, i.e. a new ‘electricity vehicles+smart grids’ system established by a coalition led by electric operators. Because of the cumulative processes between the transformation of supporting coalition and their access to higher level of competence and power, both technologies and policies can be considered as endogenous variables to transition pathways. The resulting policy prescriptions are clear-cut: if not destabilized by policy pressure, the ‘AUTO-city’ will prevail; to support the ‘ECO-city’ and the ‘ELECTRI-city’, a multilevel policy for urban and transport planning and a national innovation and industrial policy are needed, respectively.}

The advent of pervasive systems and cyber-physical systems means that access control can become dynamic, responding to the observed locations of people and objects, and meeting the stated needs of the occupants. We present three components of a smart ambient access control system for safety and security. We describe dynamic routing around mobile assets or hazards, dynamic security classification which changes the security state of rooms and zones based on observed presence of items, and dynamic zone configuration, which adapts the access states of controlled doorways to construct larger virtual zones, to provide for free movement within newly constructed zones, and to provide secure zones around assets and people as required. The components are demonstrated in an architecture integrating GPS-enabled devices, webservers, management software and optimisation solvers.}

The ongoing technological advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) era provide better solutions to enhance the management of these challenges and enforce the measures of a Smart Grid (SG). Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Smart Metering (SM) technologies are enabler technologies that can modernize the conventional power grid through exposing the hidden details of electrical power by introducing two-way communication scheme during power transaction process between utilities and consumers. Throughout literature, AMI and SM technologies are widely discussed. However, few studies discuss the role of SM in power quality and reliability monitoring in IoT-enabled SGs. Hence, the paper aims to comprehensively review the feasibility of employing SM for power quality and reliability monitoring. First, we provide a detailed overview about the SMs, wireless communication technologies, and routing algorithms as enabling technologies in AMI. Then, we categorize the existing literature works that target power quality and reliability monitoring. Finally, open research issues are outlined based on shortages in the existing literature.}

To ensure efficient distribution of the electricity, maintain low losses and high level of quality, and the security of electricity supply, the smart grid concept was proposed. The concept enables a small, individual scale to generate electricity and sell it to the grid. However, the concept adds complexity to the existing system, such as how a transaction between these generators and consumers are conducted, verified and recorded. This paper proposes the blockchain as a tool to manage transactions in the smart grid. Transactions are performed with smart contracts, and the network acts as a transaction verifier. The blockchain provides immutability of the transactions, which ensure every transaction between generators and consumers will always be executed. It also provides immutability to transaction history, which can be used for audit or solving a transaction dispute.}

To fill this gap, this study employed semi-structured interviews and participant observation to analyze the street vitality and mechanisms of operation of Dongda Street in Rugao County of Jiangsu Province in China. The study found the following. First, the interspersed urban renewal has allowed residents to retain their original lifestyles and time-space routines, and they continue to enact an endogenous street ballet. Second, new residents gradually develop new lifestyles and time-space routines in the streets, showcasing an exogenous street ballet. Third, both groups jointly perform hybrid street ballets in their daily lives through close public interactions. These findings suggest that while Dongda Street is an aging neighborhood, the survival of the original street pattern and old buildings has allowed the neighborhood to retain its historical flavor. Additionally, the moving in of creative industries and merchants injects new vitality into the neighborhood. These findings examine daily street life in the context of population contraction and help break the stereotypes of population contraction.}

In this age, the Internet of Things use allows us to optimize a series of previously complicated processes to perform and required enormous resources. One of these is optimizing the management of water treatment. This research presents an implementable water treatment model and suggests smart environment that can control water treatment plants. The proposed system gathers data and analysing to provide the most efficient approach for water desalination operations. The desalination framework integrates smart enabling technologies such as Cloud Portal, Network communication, Internet of Things, Sensors powered by solar energy with ancient water purification as part of seawater's desalination project. The proposed framework incorporates the new-age technologies, which are essential for efficient and effective operations of desalination systems. The implemented desalination dual membrane framework uses solar energy for purifying saline water using ancient methods to produce clean water for drinking and irrigation. The desalination produced 0.47 m3/l of freshwater from a saline concentration of 10 g/l, consuming 8.31 KWh/m3 energy for production from the prototype implementation, which makes desalination process cost effective.}

Through our concept of user centric regulation (UCR) we unpack what a closer alignment of IT design and regulation could mean. We also situate how they can respond to their ethical and legal duties to end users. Our concept asserts that human computer interaction (HCI) designers are now regulators and as designers are not traditionally involved in the practice of regulation hence the nature of their role is ill- defined. We believe designers need support in understanding what their new role entails, particularly managing ethical dimensions that go beyond law and compliance. We use conceptual analysis to consolidate perspectives from across Human Computer Interaction and Information Technology Law and Regulation, Computer Ethics, Philosophy of Technology, and beyond. We focus in this paper on the importance of mediation and responsibility and illustrate our argument by drawing on the emerging technological setting of smart cities.}

Currently, electricity and natural gas are the most popular fuels used in the UK Services sector and the industry. Furthermore, buildings constitute a key component of the power network, in both its current conventional form and its evolution, the smart grid. The smart grid is expected to integrate energy storage, distributed generation and buildings into the network. This paper introduces the concept of Smart Grid Optimised Buildings (SGOBs), recognising the importance of energy storage to establish a dynamic interaction between the building and the smart grid. SGOBs are expected to be fully electric, make the best use of the available resources and utilise their embedded battery storage systems to respond to notifications issued by the smart grid and to dynamic electricity prices. Assuming that buildings have access to the day-ahead electricity market, initial results show that battery storage can be successfully used to change a building’s electricity profile and perform load-shifting (arbitrage) and peak-shaving while the excess electricity is exported back to grid to take advantage of the price difference and relieve pressure on the infrastructure.}

Despite its numerous advantages, implementation is still hindered by inadequate District Heating business models and incentives. This study conducts a holistic examination on the feasibility, effectiveness and, ultimately, the efficiency of establishing a publicly owned and public-privately managed District Heating infrastructure network via a pilot intervention in the city of San Sebastian in the north of Spain. A Value Proposition Canvas, Value Creation Ecosystem and City Model Canvas analysis provides insight into fundamental patterns and relevant recommendations for other municipalities trying to find a business model in which all the involved stakeholders can capture value while addressing at the same time the energy challenges of cities.}

Cities could play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and leading the transition to renewable energy in all end-use sectors. Ulaanbaatar is the coldest capital city, and its primary energy system relies on fossil fuels. This study explores stakeholders' perceptions of a sustainable energy transition in Ulaanbaatar by 2050 using the SWOT-AHP method. Seven groups of stakeholders were involved in defining a long-term sustainable energy transition. First, stakeholders identified pathways to a sustainable energy transition through semi-structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The results show that the sustainable energy transition in the city of Ulaanbaatar by 2050 is still conventional and relies on an existing coal-based energy system. Second, stakeholders identified SWOT factors of the current situation of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar for the implementation of the sustainable energy transition. Finally, the SWOT factors were prioritized by pairwise comparisons using SWOT-AHP. Stakeholder responses varied between groups and between representatives of the same groups. The highest rated strength in the implementation of the sustainable energy transition is that the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar is now able to independently manage its budget and attract investment. Ulaanbaatar's greatest weakness is the lack of coordination between government organizations and stakeholders. The potential for renewable energy was seen as an important opportunity. The risks of political instability, which could slow, stop, or change the implementation of energy policies and projects were the greatest threat to the implementation of a sustainable energy transition.}

The proposed scenario under analysis considers multiple communication links, namely nodes to infrastructure, nodes to tractor, nodes to farmer, tractor to infrastructure and farmer to infrastructure communications. Moreover, these scenarios are proposed for tractors and agricultural equipment performance improvement and tracking, as well as resources management within the farm field. Different link type configurations are tested in order to consider the impact of ground, spatial distribution as well as infrastructure elements. The results show that LPWAN-based WSNs can provide better performance in terms of coverage and radio link quality results than ZigBee for a non-flat large-scale farm field in both cases of near-ground fixed nodes and moving tractor and farmer. The proposed systems are validated by cloud-based platforms for LoRaWAN, Sigfox and NB-IoT communications, providing flexible and scalable solutions to enable interactive farming applications.}
