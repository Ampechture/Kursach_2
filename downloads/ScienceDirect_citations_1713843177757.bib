abstract = {In this study, the challenges of incorporating PV systems and wind energy sources into smart city power grids are addressed. The fluctuating nature of renewable energy is considered, and microgrid energy management is investigated using probabilistic and deterministic assumptions. To enhance energy management, digital twin simulations are employed, providing a virtual representation of the power grid. This enables accurate analysis and prediction of system behavior in different scenarios. Digital twins help simulate the effects of load profiles on microgrids, facilitating better energy planning and decision-making. The proposed framework considers objective functions related to cost reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage stability enhancement. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is applied to solve the complex and nonlinear energy management problem, aiming to minimize costs and enhance voltage stability. Simulation results show that an optimally installed PV system and wind turbines reduce energy costs and improve overall system efficiency in smart cities. Furthermore, the objective function of WOA outperforms particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution algorithm (DEA) in achieving the desired outcomes.}

abstract = {In this paper, the performance of smart city network infrastructure is studied using space shift keying (SSK) modulation and radio-frequency (RF) based energy harvesting with cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Here, the Wireless-enabled sites can communicate data to the control unit via the access point (AP). The sites function by utilizing an energy-saving mechanism, which leads to a notable improvement in spectral efficiency. The Markov chain considers the number of active sites in the network dynamically. Moreover, energy harvesting-assisted AP helps overcome the rising demands of the city by providing an enhanced data rate, low latency, shorter coverage, widespread connectivity of the massive number of sites, and energy efficiency. The channel between sites to the AP is Nakagami-m distributed, whereas the AP is connected with the control unit through the free space optical (FSO) link. The FSO link is modelled with Gamma–Gamma distribution with pointing error impairments. The mathematical equations for average bit error probability (ABEP) are obtained for smart cities by considering mixed channels and utilizing the multi-user selection combination. The Monte Carlo simulation technique verifies the accuracy of the numerical results. According to the findings, using SSK modulation in combination with energy harvesting strategies can enhance the effectiveness of smart cities.}

However, after decades of research, governance mechanisms remain among the most undertheorized and relatively overlooked dimensions of smart city transitions. To address this problem, we conduct a systematic literature review that connects the fragmented knowledge accumulated through the observation of smart city transition dynamics in 6 continents, 43 countries, and 146 cities and regions. Our empirical work is instrumental in achieving a threefold objective. First, we assemble an overarching governance framework that expands the theoretical foundations of smart city transitions from an innovation management perspective. Second, we elaborate on this framework by providing a thorough overview of documented governance practices. This overview highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the current approaches to the governance of smart city transitions, leading to evidence-based strategic recommendations. Third, we identify and address critical knowledge gaps in a future research agenda. In linking innovation theory and urban scholarship, this agenda suggests leveraging promising cross-disciplinary connections to support more intense research efforts probing the interaction patterns between institutional contexts, urban digital innovation, and urban innovation ecosystems.}

A new design for an electromagnetic road energy harvester is proposed, and its performance is evaluated through numerical simulations and experiments. The new method can generate sufficient electricity to run the low-power facilities of the smart cities in real-time and provide enough power for further applications using energy storage devices. Unlike the current road energy harvesters, the new harvester has a compact design, negligible mismatch risk between the components, and is more compatible with high-speed roadways. It can be used as road rumbles, transverse rumbles, or smooth speed bumps with a minimal vertical displacement of a maximum of 25 mm. It is shown that the harvester can illuminate LED light bulbs of 2 W at a displacement of 18 mm, which is compatible with the required depth of road rumbles. This power generation level satisfies sensors and IoT requirements and can also be stored for large-scale applications.}

At present the only battery energy storage is available, and it is effective only for storing modest quantities of energy for short periods of time. The other storage technology options are not often commercially available items; rather, they are just good concepts that need to be tested for viability. Currently, the only alternative options for turning an urban development into one that exclusively uses green energy is to use that energy to generate hydrogen through electrolyzers, then use this fuel to generate the required electricity in order to stabilize the grid. Even more appealing is the idea of using wind and photovoltaic energy to transform smart communities into a centre for producing hydrogen in addition to a city that solely uses renewable energy. The most likely solution, absent an urgent debate inside the science establishment, will be to import electricity from the burning of hydrocarbons while continuing to pay carbon offsets, which is incompatible with the goal of using only renewables. The smart city has not officially accepted this issue, just like the science establishment.}

In this novel study, we investigate the effect of China's smart city policy on household daily consumption and carbon emissions. The empirical analysis is based on a difference-in-differences regression, in which the dependent variable is the household indirect carbon emissions estimated based on the consumer lifestyle approach and a dataset of 201 Chinese cities between 2010 and 2018. The main findings are as follows. First, the smart city policy significantly reduces household indirect carbon emissions, and the reduction is greater when the policy pilot region includes the whole city rather than only certain subareas. Second, the mechanisms through which the smart city influences household indirect carbon emissions are mainly the reductions in transportation- and education-related emissions resulting from developments in smart technology. Third, the above effects last for years, and they are regionally heterogeneous and more significant in the cities of eastern China. The findings in this paper suggest that smart cities can potentially achieve city sustainability by promoting greener consumption behavior.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and the growing tourism industry in the Himalayan region have raised significant concerns about the sustainable handling and management of solid waste in the area. This concern is particularly pronounced in the unique and vulnerable ecosystem of cities nestled in the eastern Indian Himalayas, where geography, ecology, and socio-economic factors converge to create distinctive challenges. This study undertakes a thorough investigation of solid waste management practices and challenges in two smart cities nestled in the eastern Himalayan region of India, specifically Gangtok and Namchi. The primary objective was to unveil the complex challenges confronting these cities by conducting an in-depth exploration of waste management practices. This comprehensive investigation was achieved through the collection of samples, conducting surveys within each ward of the cities, and performing physicochemical characterization analyses. The study also proposes a solution-oriented approach leveraging life cycle analysis. Despite the Himalayan backdrop, waste generation varies significantly, with Gangtok producing substantially more waste (50 tons per day (TPD)) compared to Namchi (4.6 TPD). Both cities excel in waste collection, but Gangtok leads in proactive treatment, with 22% (11 TPD) undergoing composting and recycling. However, shared challenges at riverside disposal sites, including overfilled dumpsites and leachate contamination, pose potential environmental hazards amid the Himalayan allure. Organic waste predominates at 40.9% and 40.01% in both cities, indicating composting potential. Plastic closely at 22.25% (Namchi) and 22.65% (Gangtok) was way above the global (12 %) and national (8.4 %) average respectively, emphasizing the urgency of plastic waste reduction strategy. The 16.95% cardboard in Gangtok highlights potential commerce-related waste. The study also highlights the importance of comprehensive policies for informal sector well-being. The lifecycle assessment of Namchi and Gangtok reveals significant methane emissions (99%) from waste anaerobic decomposition potentially due to poor source segregation. Implementing a futuristic waste strategy reduces emissions by 38% in Namchi and 40% in Gangtok, through biogas utilization and renewable energy adoption. The findings advocate for citizen engagement, improved collection, targeted campaigns, and circular economy principles. To ensure sustainability and resilience in waste management within mountain regions, tailored strategies such as material recycling facilities, community engagement initiatives, and landfill diversion mandates should integrate ecological, socioeconomic, and logistical considerations, fostering awareness and participation among communities.}

Spatial correlation analysis revealed a notable autocorrelation of rental housing prices in Hefei, exhibiting a distribution pattern of decreasing values from the city center outward. Besides, the impact of 13 factors on house rent was examined. Overall, factors such as building area, proximity to wet markets, and distance from the top three hospitals were demonstrated to exert the most significant influence on rental housing prices in Hefei. The decision-making of smart cities needs to be scientifically analyzed to find out the factors affecting the price of rental housing in the region, and the research conclusions can provide certain references for urban decision-makers in the overall management of urban resources and targeted solutions to regional housing rental and other issues.}

The mechanism analysis suggests that SCC affects corporate employment through factor substitution rather than job creation by promoting digital capitalization and capital and technological factor substitution. Further analyses indicate that SCC primarily reduces the number of low-skilled and non-production employees and has a stronger impact on local private, old, and industrial firms. We also find evidence of labor reallocation effects of SCC. Overall, the results highlight the trade-off between promoting SCC and mitigating employment challenges and the role of data as a new production factor in the digital economy era, providing important policy implications for stakeholders.}

Question, however, remains whether the accumulation of these attributes results in tangible benefits for local residents. To answer this question, we compare different metrices of city smartness with several indicators of intra–urban income disparity and environmental performance, using data available for 100+ major cities worldwide. As the analysis indicates, the proliferation of internet technologies and the number of universities the city hosts, i.e., popular ways of advancing “smartness”, are not related to either intra–urban income disparity or environmental performance of cities per se. We thus suggest that the transition of cities towards greater smartness should be focused on people's needs and ICT-using skills, not on ICT proliferation per se. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that links the level of city smartness with intra–urban income inequality and environmental performance of cities and substantiates these links empirically. By accumulating this knowledge, the study helps to understand better the smart city phenomenon and its impact on urban development.}

The enormously rising population in cities brings with it numerous problems that need to be deeply addressed. New approaches are required in solving many issues such as the management of scarce resources in the city, and the access of city residents to clean air and water. The smart city concept, which freshly emerged with the approach of adapting advanced technological facilities to city administrations, may be able to assist to cope with these problems. The levels of embracement and implementation of the smart city concept play a fundamental role in the well-being of people living in urban areas. Measuring smart city performances, especially in metropolitan cities, can guide the management of local or national investments to improve society's quality of life. In this study, the smart city performance assessment of 30 metropolitan municipalities in Türkiye using a two-stage methodology is included. The scores of smart city index indicators determined by the literature review for Türkiye were calculated using MEthod based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC), which is a recent multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. In the second part of the methodology, 30 metropolitan municipalities were ranked based on weighted criteria using another MCDM approach Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS). The methodology is compared with different MCDM approaches. As a result of the study, it has been revealed that the best city according to the methodology is İstanbul. Also, Antalya, İzmir and Konya have also been among the prominent cities with high smart city scores. The aim of this study is to contribute to the analysis of the issues where the investment should be focused on by measuring the smart city performances of metropolitan cities.}

The suggested approach increases the flexibility of lighting loads while considering energy production fluctuations of green buildings' integrated photovoltaics. This technique applies a mathematical model to define the relationship between the produced energy by building integrated photovoltaics and lighting demands. The control process is then performed by adjusting lighting loads based on the specified algorithm. Also, the suggested technique maintains minimum lighting levels and satisfies users' visual comfort. The proposed strategy can also be applied to a wide variety of demands in a building. By categorizing loads as fundamental and flexible, comparable patterns can be defined to control other flexible loads in a complex. Results from the system simulation confirm the precision of this technique. According to the results, for variations in BIPV production, the control system applies the necessary settings based on the defined algorithm and regulates energy consumption and lighting levels.

Integrating digital technologies into urban areas affects individuals differently based on their sociodemographic factors such as age, academic degree, income, and gender. There are various studies on smart cities social risks, however, the relationship between sociodemographic factors and social risks in smart city development programs has not been thoroughly understood to date. This paper aims to prioritise social risks for smart city development and to investigate the correlations between these risks and sociodemographic factors by conducting a questionnaire survey. The results revealed that social exclusion is the highest social risk, and older adults and females are the most sensitive sociodemographic groups regarding smart city risks. The finding also indicated that income and academic degree have no meaningful correlation with social risks. This study highlights the significance of social risks and their correlations with sociodemographic factors for developing smart cities. It enables city authorities and local governments to create an effective risk management plan for their smart city development programs.}

abstract = {The goal of managing smart cities and societies is to maximize the efficient use of finite resources while enhancing the quality of life. To establish a sustainable urban existence, smart cities use some new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Drones (IoD), and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The created data by these technologies are submitted to analytics to obtain new information for increasing the smart societies and cities' efficiency and effectiveness. Also, smart traffic management, smart power, and energy management, city surveillance, smart buildings, and patient healthcare monitoring are the most common applications in smart cities. However, the Artificial intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) approach all hold a lot of promise for managing automated activities in smart cities. Therefore, we discuss different research issues and possible research paths in which the aforementioned techniques might help materialize the smart city notion. The goal of this research is to offer a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of smart city and society management, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that require further investigation and consideration. IoT, cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, IoD, IoV, and hybrid models are the seven key emerging developments in information technology that, in this paper, are considered to categorize the state-of-the-art techniques. The results indicate that the Conventional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the most commonly used ML method in the publications. According to research, the majority of papers are about smart cities' power and energy management. Furthermore, most papers have concentrated on improving only one parameter, where the accuracy parameter obtains the most attention. In addition, Python is the most frequently used language, which was used in 69.8% of the papers.}

Smart public lighting systems are designed using LED light sources in combination with a controller based on light intensity and motion sensors to control the brightness in working areas as per standard requirements. The control of smart public lighting systems is designed to operate in three modes: manual, scheduled, and auto modes, which are tested and compared in terms of lighting and power quality. Other functions of IoT, such as air pollution detection, security system-based video surveillance, and warning systems for flood disasters, are integrated into smart public lighting systems. A prototype of the designed smart public lighting system is presented in this paper. The parameters of average illuminance, overall uniformity, and threshold increment were implemented using DIALux software to optimise the luminaire spacing. The results showed that the goal of energy saving could be achieved using the auto mode. Although the automatic mode caused current harmonic distortion to the electrical grid, the harmonic value was less than the specified standard. Furthermore, the precision of IoT system operation was dependent on environmental variations and the reliability of wireless network technology.}

The prior literature stresses the importance of environmental policies, yet less attention has been paid to digital policies required to drive eco-innovation and their spatial dimension in the context of a developing economy. Our results show that, when digital policies (artificial intelligence and internet of things) are implemented in cities that have adopted strict environmental policies, the production of green patents increases. We contribute to debates in the literature of policy mix for sustainability transitions in the context of a developing economy by illustrating the importance of both types of policy for eco-innovation, as they correct two market failures and, more importantly, address the systemic coordination problems that occur during the production of green patents.}

Recent WHO global air pollution guidelines highlight air pollution as a critical environmental threat along with climate change. To address these threats, smart cities and clean air programs are on a rise. In smart cities, data and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are major drivers of city transformations. The 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing have the potential to accelerate these transformations toward urban resilience. However, the success of smart cities and clean air programs depends on cohesive multi-sector stakeholder contributions. This study conducted interdisciplinary participative stakeholder analysis to understand the data, and sectorial challenges, to outline the technological opportunities to facilitate clean air programs in Indian smart cities. The research highlights gaps due to siloed stakeholder operations, lack of data calibration, non-alignment of smart city and air quality management services, non-availability of health exposure data, and difficulty in translating scientific data into implementable actions. Stakeholders expressed potential ‘fit for the purpose’ use of IoT devices, satellites, smartphones, and mobility data augmented by AI methods in bridging these gaps. The analysis points toward a need to develop an easily accessible and ubiquitous urban data governance ecosystem enabling seamless cross-sector data exchanges to build trusting relationships among the stakeholders across the air quality management value chain}

The advent of generation mobile systems, the so-called 5 G in the early century, has realized this dream. 5 G can provide network services with extremely-high throughput and extremely-low delay and allows a huge device number to connect based on Internet infrastructure, forming the Internet of Things (IoT). In recent years, IoT has been applied in various fields serving humanity, such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, education, military, and IoT ecosystems. One of the main challenges of IoT applications is computing solutions to reduce service response times. This study proposes an efficient edge computing management mechanism for IoT applications in smart cities. Our mechanism proposes a small database (called an information map) that allows edge computing servers of smart cities to store edge service information. When the mobile end-users move to the new edge server' managed coverage, properties related to the EC service are exchanged between the edge servers. The experiment results have shown that our proposed mechanism improves service response time and energy consumption many times compared to the traditional mechanism. We hope that this mechanism will be strongly applied to sustainable smart cities in the future.}

However, we know very little about the roles and effect of smart city policy in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) air pollution. Using Chinese city-level panel data, we investigate the impact of national smart city pilots on satellite-derived ground level NO2 concentrations by Difference-in-Differences method. The results show that the smart city policy is conductive to mitigating the NO2 concentrations in pilot cities, especially for the cities with large population, high administrative hierarchies and located in eastern China. In particular, the mitigation effect of first round smart city pilots is greater than the second and third rounds. The mechanisms of smart city policy mitigating NO2 concentrations is to optimize energy structure and advance treatment technology, rather than directly reduce fossil energy consumption. Therefore, smart city policy may be a win-win choice for developing countries to break the trade-off between air pollution and economic development.}

The increase in supply-side energy production is one method of alleviating peak demand proposed by a few investigations. As peak loads last for a short time, additional installations might be required. In addition, facilities that store energy can be used to reduce peak demand. As a consequence of the previous investigation, interruptible load regulation was not taken into account in optimizing system performance. The regulation of interruptible loads can greatly reduce system peak loads in smart city and within the concept of microgrids (MGs). The study proposes an interruptible load scheduling (ILS) scheme that considers consumer subsidy rates with the goal of reducing the peak load of the MG and its operating prices. To this end, a digital twin is developed in which the consumer interruption load time and minimal per-day load decrease restrictions have been completely met in the scheme. The ILS model is solved using a combination of the Min-Conflict Algorithm and the Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested algorithm and the show the substantial benefits of the scheme in reducing peak loads and operating prices in smart cities.}

Children's and young people's positions in smart cities are unstable and, depending on a project's agenda, ever-shifting – at the centre of a bottom-up movement, on the fringes of top-down planned programmes. This article revolves around the everyday experiences of children and young people and explores how they encounter life in a smart city district. It draws on observations from a qualitative case study with children and young people in a Viennese neighbourhood where an EU smart city lighthouse project was implemented from 2016 to 2019. Drawing on ethnographic research with children and young people in a school, an afterschool centre, and an open child and youth care programme in a city park, I develop three dimensions of encounters: how children and young people move through, interact with, and take care of the city. My findings show that many children and young people perceive crises with the same urgency as smart city programmes and are equally interested in technological innovation, environmental protection, and social inclusion. They demonstrate responsibility and care about socio-ecological challenges and approaches to solutions. However, young people's discourses and practices also show that urban life cannot be limited to certain issues, nor do young people's urban lives end at structural or administrative boundaries. Participants also emphasise that focusing on human beings alone does not lead to sustainable urban development, and they express frustration with measures that bypass the reality of their lives and divert much-needed attention away from pressing issues.}

To this end, this paper proposes a traffic flow prediction method for smart cities (RL-GCN) based on graph convolution, LSTM network and reinforcement learning, aiming to solve the problem of urban traffic flow prediction. Firstly, we use the graph convolutional neural network to process the urban traffic network data features, then use the LSTM network model to learn the temporal information, and then combine the reinforcement learning algorithm to develop the optimal traffic control strategy based on which the future traffic flow is predicted. Our experiments on several datasets show that the model developed in this paper has outstanding performance for urban traffic flow prediction. Compared with the traditional traffic flow prediction methods, the method in this paper has significantly improved prediction accuracy. Our research can provide valuable references and inspiration in urban planning and traffic management.}

This study developed a decision-making approach to determine the supply and demand priority of SC services using utility and need theories, with Hong Kong as a case study. The results show that smart environment services should be prioritized for all population groups, while the differences in priority among older adults, people with lower digital literacy, and people with lower income were relatively small. On the one hand, the supply of SC services should be prioritized for those that are closely linked to citizens’ daily lives, have a long-term impact on communities, and are targeted to large user groups. On the other hand, priority should be given to those services that meet citizens’ demands for physiological, safety, and self-actualization needs. This study enriches the theoretical framework of people-centric SC research through the innovative integration of Bradley-Terry and rank-ordered logit models for determining the development priority for SC services, which can serve as a practical decision-making tool for policy makers to effectively allocate resources for sustainable SC development.}

Investing in human capital and improving quality of life have become the major elements of SMC rhetoric. However, few studies have examined the approaches adopted in real-world SMC policymaking or why different cities follow different approaches. We statistically examine the factors behind the human-centricity of SMC policies through a text analysis of policy documents from 341 Chinese prefectural cities published between 2009 and 2020. We find divergent approaches to SMC development across these Chinese prefectural cities. Unexpectedly, the more economically developed and dense cities tend to be more technology-centric in SMC policymaking. Cities at the initial and advanced stages of SMC development also prefer a technology-centric approach, albeit with very different underlying mechanisms. These findings suggest the need for a greater prioritization of human capital in SMC creation in developed cities and for context-specific interpretations of technology-centricity for cities at different SMC development stages.}

Smart cities and their applications aim to maintain a high quality of life by using smart technologies and enhancing economic productivity. Previous systematic literature reviews have considered the development of smart cities and highlighted their applications and services. However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated smart cities in relation to emergencies. To this end, the current paper aims to provide a research agenda reviewing the relevant literature that touches on smart technologies during emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic methodology centred on text mining analysis, our research identified the following three themes: (a) emergency response, which covers emergency management, traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles, waste disposal, and contact tracing; (b) motivation and outcome, which includes such sub-themes as smart urbanism, quality of life and the economy; and (c) technology and data, which covers social media, machine learning, Internet of Things, data-driven applications, and object detection. We comprehensively discuss each theme and offer suggestions for future research.}

Some possible IoT application areas have not been looked into yet or do not have enough information on how to approach them. This shows that more research needs to be done in this difficult area to find new and potentially big benefits for society. Although smart cities offer residents and providers of capital several advantages, there are numerous ways that breaches could compromise the safety and security of individuals. As a result, several different recommendation designs can coexist in the IoT. This research examines the effects of ethics and technology on the security of IoT-enabled systems in smart city infrastructure. Hence provides a secure IoT network architecture for smart cities combining blockchain and deep learning to safeguard privacy and credibility. This research presents a Secure Smart City Infrastructure using Blockchain and Deep Learning (SSCI-BDL) framework to ensure privacy protection and trustworthiness among IoT communication in smart cities. This framework involves the blockchain network for security management in the smart city infrastructure. This framework integrates the deep learning model with an optimization algorithm that maintains efficient resource utilization in the smart city infrastructure. The simulation results show that the system has high security of 99.5% and the lowest latency rate of 4.1% compared to existing models.

Based on a literature review on smart city construction and carbon emissions, this study uses a multi-period difference-in-difference model for empirical analysis, aiming to assess the impact of smart city pilot policy on carbon productivity. We find that: (1) Smart city construction has increased urban carbon productivity by 2.045%. Among them, the promotion effect of eastern and central cities is noticeable, while western cities have a restraining effect. (2) The impact of smart city construction on carbon productivity has a time-lag effect. The pilot policy will take effect in the third year of implementation and reach its maximum value in the fifth year. (3) Smart city construction can improve urban carbon productivity through technological progress, industrial structure upgrading, and energy structure optimization.

Taking advantage of vehicular communications, in this paper we propose novel mechanisms for the acceleration of the rescue operation resulting in a reduction in fatalities in accidents. We propose a Software-Defined Traffic Light Preemption (SD-TLP) mechanism that enables Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMVs) to travel along the rescue route with minimal interruptions. The SD-TLP makes preemption decisions based on global knowledge of the traffic conditions in the city. We also propose mechanisms for the selection of the nearest emergency center and fast discharge of the route of EMVs. Furthermore, depending on the dynamic traffic conditions on the streets at the time of the accident, an appropriate rescue route is selected for the EMV before its departure. The proposed approach is evaluated using the OMNET++ and SUMO tools over part of the Megacity of Tabriz, Iran. The simulation results demonstrate that the method can reduce the average rescue time significantly. The proposed approach keeps the resulting disruption in city traffic acceptably low while trying to shorten the rescue time as much as possible.}

Smart cities are reconceptualized as smart social substances forming the basis of social interactions in which citizens themselves are involved in negotiating human–computer interactions in the processes of social learning, negotiating and adapting to ICT devices, and prompting behavior change to achieve the desired condition in the cities. In this study, responses from 548 citizens living in China in an online questionnaire are examined using a structural equation modeling technique for data analysis, and a theoretical model is proposed based on social learning theory. The results reveal that high-quality responsiveness and information content of a digital learning service have a significant positive effect on commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy. Additionally, we find that commitment to community and ICT self-efficacy have a significant positive effect on online civic engagement. Moreover, commitment to community mediates the effect of information content, responsiveness, and environment quality on online civic engagement. Our research findings suggest that, in their efforts to improve online civic engagement, smart city implementation practitioners can enhance citizens’ individual commitment to community and foster ICT self-efficacy via high-quality ICT devices and digital learning services.}

From this perspective, to efficiently manage both the supply and demand sides of energy in buildings, this study proposes a novel approach for grid-connected building integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) considering the price of electricity. Regarding real-time electricity prices, the presented method allows for selecting grid electricity or photovoltaics per peak, off-peak, and between these two. In addition to reducing costs, this strategy lessens photovoltaic installation capacity and increases the justification of BIPVs. Considering demand-side management, proper control in terms of economic aspects is conducted based on the system's defined model and the price of electricity. The suggested technique outperforms other applied methods when both energy supply and demand are considered, as well as real-time electricity prices. The validity of this technique is confirmed by simulation results of system performance in a setting and for lighting loads. This approach advocates for establishing smart buildings and cities in tandem with the growth of smart grids and liberalized energy markets.}

We employ specialized energy flow algorithms for each grid, designing energy hubs that leverage renewable resources and mobile storage to enhance sustainability. To address complexity, our model utilizes a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming structure and robust adaptive optimization techniques, combining the Gray Wolf and Krill Herd algorithms. Through simulations, we demonstrate significant improvements in power system efficiency, including notable reductions in power loss, peak voltage fluctuations, and temperature variations.

We find that (1) smart city construction has reduced PM2.5 concentrations by 5.34%, and the reducing effect is increasing over time. The results remained valid after overcoming endogeneity problems and passing a series of robustness tests. (2) Smart city pilots have spatial spillover effect, which has a positive impact on PM2.5 of cities within 50km, while significantly reduces PM2.5 of surrounding cities within 50km-250km. (3) The PM2.5 reducing effect of smart cities is primarily the result of technological effect and allocation effect generated by promoting innovation and industrial upgrading.

A smart municipality in a smart city is a concept in which a digital municipal corporation is developed to provide comprehensive local government collaboration services based on digitization and automation aiming towards raising the living standards of citizens. Interoperability between heterogeneous services for collaborative tasks creates challenges for data security and privacy. Ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information is critical, and reliable data is essential to both the government and its citizens.

The proposed collaborative service security framework is being tested on the Multichain Blockchain networks. We present a novel method for using smart contracts in multichain blockchains for data security during collaborative tasks in smart city municipal architecture. The proposed security solution is based on the dynamism of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions securely between different heterogeneous IoT networks. We implemented a supportive use case for collaborative services in an SDN-enabled IoT architecture to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed service security architecture.}

Understanding the shades of urban resilience and livability in smart city models is of paramount importance. This study presents a novel two-stage data-driven framework combining a multivariate metric-distance analysis with machine learning (ML) techniques for resilience and livability assessment of smart cities. A longitudinal dataset for 35 top-ranked European smart cities from 2015 till 2020 applied as the case study under the proposed framework. Initially, a metric distance-based weighting approach is used to weight the indicators and quantify the scores across each aspect under city resilience and urban livability. The key aspects under city resilience include social, economic, infrastructure and built environment and, institutional resilience, while under urban livability, the aspects include accessibility, community well-being, and economic vibrancy. Fuzzy c-means clustering as an unsupervised machine learning technique is used to sort smart cities based on the degree of performance. In addition, an intelligent approach is presented for the prediction of the degree of livability, resilience, and aggregate performance of smart cities based on various supervised ML techniques. Classification models such as Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and, ensemble models including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting machine (GBM) were used. Three coefficients (accuracy, Cohen's Kappa (κ) and average area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR)) along with confusion matrix were used to appraise the performance of the classifier ML models. The results revealed GBM as the best classification and predictive model for the resilience, livability, and aggregate performance assessment. The study also revealed Copenhagen, Geneva, Stockholm, Munich, Helsinki, Vienna, London, Oslo, Zurich, and Amsterdam as the smart cities that co-create resilience and livability in their development model with superior performance.}

abstract = {The development of smart cities has seen a shift in governance systems where citizens have gone from mere recipients of services to co-creators. As smart cities rely heavily on Information and Communication Technologies to achieve their goals, it is a challenge to engage older populations in digital participatory processes. A project-based learning course was developed at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to challenge master students across all study programs to come up with ideas for tackling this issue. This paper presents the results of their multidisciplinary collaboration applied to real cases in municipalities in Norway. We find that a transgenerational approach is essential in the design and development phase of participatory methods to ensure better implementation and uptake of technologies.}

Making cities smarter implies not only technological innovation and deployment, but also having smart people and effective policies. Cities can acquire knowledge and incorporate governance lessons from other jurisdictions to develop smart city initiatives that are unique to the local contexts. We conducted two rounds of surveys involving 23 experts on an e-Delphi platform to consolidate their opinion on factors that facilitate policy transfer among smart cities. Findings show a consensus on the importance of six factors: having a policy entrepreneur; financial instruments; cities’ enthusiasm for policy learning; capacity building; explicit regulatory mechanisms; and policy adaptation to local contexts. Correspondingly, three policy recommendations were drawn. Formalizing collaborative mechanisms and joint partnerships between cities, setting up regional or international networks of smart cities, and establishing smart city repositories to collect useful case studies for urban planning and governance lessons will accelerate policy transfer for smart city development. This study sheds light on effective ways policymakers can foster policy learning and transfer, especially when a jurisdiction's capacity is insufficient to deal with the uncertainties and challenges ahead.}

It enables the development of smart infrastructure and provides assistance in emergency services during disasters. However, there is a growing need to develop energy-conserving paradigms that cover all aspects of a smart city. In this work, the authors present a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) inspired greedy strategy-based mutation operation for IoT-enabled heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) distributed architecture in a technology driven city. The proposed protocol aims to design a weighted fitness function that considers four parameters: node density, residual and average energy, and distance parameters. Additionally, a 3-tier heterogeneity is considered to prolong the network functional duration, and a deployment strategy is addressed to position these nodes in an energy-efficient manner. The proposed algorithm achieves 31.41%, 20.42%, 13.37%, 1.59% increase in network lifespan compared to GA-based optimized clustering (GAOC), optimized GA with single sink (OptiGAS-StSS), multiple sinks (MS) based GAOC and optimized GA with multiple sink (OptiGAS-StMS), respectively. The significant enhancement in network lifespan is an outcome of choosing the most efficient CH nodes based on the proposed fitness function. Overall, the proposed protocol contributes to developing an energy-conserving paradigm for a smart city.}

The results show that urban innovation performance benefits from the construction of smart cities, and the promotion effect is sustainable. The level of economic development and information infrastructure, as well as the financial innovation expenditure, have a beneficial effect in encouraging smart city construction innovation performance, while the degree of opening-up hinders the improvement of smart city urban innovation performance. In addition, it is also found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance.

The way of the MCDM combined with geographical information system (GIS) techniques provides a significant aspect to consider when developing a flood risk model or early warning system. A case study of flood risk assessment in the Shanghai is used to demonstrate the application of the MCDM techniques incorporating GIS to assess flood risk of metro system. The assessed flood risk of metro systems provides inceptive suggestions for designing flood prevention in metro systems. Based on the initial flood risk of metro systems, a large amount of data collected using 3S including remote sensing (RS), GIS, global position system (GPS) technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and wireless sensor networks, can be adopted to increase the accuracy of flood risk management for metro systems in smart city development.

Since the administrative authorities that manage cities often lack the knowledge and skills needed to transform their operations in this way, smart city initiatives usually involve a complex set of actors, from local urban authorities and their technical departments to small and large IT firms, academics, and civic organizations, as well as individual citizens. Mediating organizations are often set up to coordinate and manage such interactions. However, little is known about the roles and activities of such bodies. Using data from the Dublin smart city projects, this study draws on the concept of boundary spanning to develop a taxonomy of the work of such intermediaries. Divided into technical, political, social, and cultural domains, the study demonstrates the critical role of the work done by such bodies in enhancing collaboration among and the participation of a diverse group of citizens, IT and digital strategy departments of local authorities, universities and local/international IT companies (e.g., Google, Facebook or Airbnb), leading to a bottom-up governance style of leading smart city initiatives and projects.}

This study traces the impacts of urbanization, innovation, income, and energy consumption on CE for the G7 countries from 1995 to 2019. The time period is important due to the rapid increase in urbanization, globalization, and, at the same time, technology diffusion. The study is focused on novel and relevant panel data econometric methods that tackle cross-section dependence, non-normality of data, and heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The empirical outcome first confirms the long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables in the presence of structural breaks by employing the advanced panel cointegration test. Technologies related to environmental management and energy consumption are positively linked with CE. However, the role of income per capita is found to be inverse with CE. In contrast, the effect of urbanization in different models is mixed for CE. Innovation and its interaction with urbanization are crucial for limiting CE and promoting sustainable cities in G7 economies. This indicates that urbanization with environment-friendly innovation can help G7 countries foster sustainable cities and achieve COP27 targets in general, specifically the Sustainable Development Goal of sustainable cities. The results were tested for the multiplicative effect of different variables with urbanization and innovation. Regarding policy insights, the study recommends focusing on smart and sustainable cities with environment-related innovations and transitioning towards cleaner energy from conventional energy consumption.}

The scale of this effort is unsuitable for a single player, instead necessitating joint efforts from multiple stakeholders. The global expansion of smart cities has subsequently led to increased research efforts toward building effective smart cities. In theory and practice, collaboration is pivotal for effective urban development, most often seen through the establishment of public-private partnership (PPP). Past research has explored these partnerships in smart city projects. Although PPP is considered to be an effective means to facilitate smart city development, the concept of smart cities remains rather vague and ideological. PPP for smart cities has been substantiated in several case studies; however, a thorough review is lacking. Therefore, to synthesize the existing literature, we carried out an in-depth integrative literature review. From this basis, we executed a content analysis and four key themes emerged: localness, stakeholder complexity, tension, and trust-building. These four themes form the basis of our proposed model and describe the key elements influencing PPP formation in smart city projects. We argue that the partnerships involved in smart city projects need further refinement to allow for transparency and involvement in various contexts. This paper provides timely contributions to smart city research by synthesizing the extant literature as well as laying the foundation for a future research agenda. Critical perspectives are also offered for future practitioners.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology involves a network of interconnected devices and sensors that gather and exchange information. In smart cities, IoT devices were utilized in several fields including energy, transportation, waste management, healthcare, etc., to improve the overall quality of life and sustainability of the populace. But, as the usage of IoT increases, the cybersecurity and data privacy become a concern of safety. An anomaly detection system helps to identify possible data breaches or cyber-attacks by identifying abnormal data patterns. Deep learning (DL) driven anomaly detection has emerged as an effective and powerful method for identifying abnormal behaviours or patterns in the data domain. This technique leverages the abilities of a deep neural network for automated learning of complex patterns and representations from data, which make it better for anomaly detection task where irregularities cannot be easily defined by handcrafted rules. This paper establishes a new Billiard Based Optimization with Deep Learning Driven Anomaly Detection and Classification (BBODL-ADC) technique in IoT-assisted Sustainable Smart Cities. The goal of the BBODL-ADC technique lies in the proper recognition and classification of anomalies in the IoT-assisted smart city. To obtain that, the BBODL-ADC system applies a binary pigeon optimization algorithm (BPEO) algorithm for the effectual selection of features. Besides, the BBODL-ADC technique utilizes Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) approach for the recognition and classification of anomalies. Moreover, the BBO system can be used for better parameters chosen by the ERNN algorithm. The stimulation value of the BBODL-ADC algorithm can be executed benchmark database. The achieved outcomes demonstrate the remarkable outcome of the BBODL-ADC methodology of 95.69% and 99.21% compared to existing models under dataset-1 and dataset-2.}

This research introduces a novel IoT-driven SPMS that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology, termed as IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN, to surmount typical restrictions related to communication range, energy usage, and implementation cost seen in traditional systems. IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN features intelligent sensing nodes that incorporate an Arduino UNO microcontroller and two sensors—a triaxial magnetic sensor and a waterproof ultrasonic sensor. These components collaboratively detect vehicle occupancy and transmit this data to the server via a LoRaWAN gateway. Notably, the integration of LoRa technology enables extensive network coverage and energy efficiency. Users are provided with real-time updates on parking availability via the accessible AllThingsTalk Maker graphical user interface. Additionally, the system operates independently, sustained by a solar-powered rechargeable battery. Practical testing of IoT-SPMS-LoRaWAN under various scenarios validates its merits in terms of functionality, ease of use, reliable data transmission, and precision. Its urban implementation is expected to alleviate traffic congestion, optimize parking utilization, and elevate awareness about available parking spaces among users. Primarily, this study enriches the realm of smart city solutions by enhancing the efficiency of parking management and user experience via IoT.}

This article proposes an Information-centric Networking System using Multiaccess Edge Computing (ICNMEC) to reduce computation offloading and optimize data traffic. This system's 5G network slicing approaches combine edge computing and software characterization. Internet of Things applications have been used to store and analyze the information gathered. In addition, an algorithm known as OMNM (Optimized Memory Network Management) is created to control network traffic better and better use of storage. With minimal delays, network traffic, and storage ratio, the system's modelling tests demonstrate that it is very efficient. This method can progressively enhance the pace at which one can access and use the system. The performance assessment shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency ratio of 95.141%, storage utilization ratio of 60.1% and access rate by 0.9, reducing network traffic and delay by 0.6.}

Subjective QOL was measured by three indicators: life satisfaction, frequency of happy emotions, and frequency of depressed emotions. Results show that ICT is negatively associated with life satisfaction and the frequency of happy (positive) emotions, but not associated with depressed (negative) emotions. Human capital, by contrast, has a positive impact on life satisfaction and the frequency of happy emotions but has a negative impact on the frequency of depressed emotions. Further, ICT and human capital can affect subjective QOL through perceived government corruption and government performance. In addition, the impact of smart city investments on subjective QOL varies greatly according to age and education level. Policy implications are proposed to improve subjective QOL by making full use of smart investments.}

One of the main challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights, including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.}

As vehicles are being electrified, further advances will be needed to meet social, environmental, and economic sustainability targets, and a more efficient use of vehicles and public transport is central in this endeavor. Accordingly, Electric Mobility as a Service (eMaaS) has developed as a concept with the potential to increase sustainability mobility in cities and been designated as a phenomenon with potential to radically change how people move in the future. But presently there is the lack of a common business model that supports complex integration of all actors, digital technologies, and infrastructures involved in the eMaaS business ecosystem. This study aims to support the further development of eMaaS by providing a state of the art of eMaaS and further proposes a digital ecosystem as a business model for eMaaS sharing in smart cities. Accordingly, a systematic literature review was adopted grounded on secondary data from the literature to offers a new approach to urban mobility and demonstrate the suitability of the eMaaS concept in smart communities. The digital ecosystem is designed based on system design approach. Findings from this study provides a sustainable policy perspective, discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development of eMaaS and its impact on electrification of vehicles. Overall, findings from this study considers the role of electric vehicles as part of the mobility sharing economy.

We present a four-layer architectural framework to integrate individual logistics objects and systems into Smart Cities at a semantic level, with underlying enabling technologies and standards including Property Graph, Web Ontology Language (OWL), and Web of Things. Next, we conduct a case study of parcel delivery in Paris using a real-life Digital Twins platform called Thing in the future (Thing’in) by Orange France, coupled with an agent-based simulation model on AnyLogic, to demonstrate a real-world application of our approach. The results suggest that semantics-enabled Digital Twins connectivity can increase the comprehensive understanding of the delivery environment and enhance cooperation between heterogeneous systems, ultimately resulting in improved logistics efficiency, reduced negative externalities, and better utilization of resources. Furthermore, this work showcases potential new business services for logistics service providers and provides managerial insights for city planners and municipal policymakers. An actual mobile application prototype is presented to showcase the applicability of the work.}

abstract = {The technologically endowed Smart Cities take credit for managing the COVID-19 pandemic more effectively than other urban centers. However, Indian smart cities seemed unprepared for the outbreak, with reported highest cases of death and positivity rates. Thus, it becomes essential to understand why these smart cities could not handle the pandemic despite their technologically advanced infrastructures and the citizen’s role in managing it. This paper analyzes the impact of the Smart City Mission (SCM) interventions from a citizen-centric perspective and its influence on pandemic management and citizen inclusivity. The study draws from the right to the smart city framework along with stages of the digital divide. The study conducted a content analysis using secondary sources like published and unpublished papers, policy reports, and news analyses spanning the timeline of 2015-2022. The analysis infers that the lack of initiatives to link marginalized citizens with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) through the SCM policy led to the underutilization of the various initiatives launched during the pandemic, deepening the digital divide. The deduction from the analysis highlights that the ‘chatur citizens’ act as a solution by transitioning their formal access to ICTs into effective access enabling the marginalized communities to bridge the divide.}

The central objective of this paper is to address the integrity and quality of the existing smart city indices, and identify those ones which are fit for international comparison. We propose a method for evaluating the integrity and quality of the existing smart city indices in terms of five criteria – Credibility, Reliability, Methodology, Versatility, Precision. The article critically evaluates six smart city indices and concludes that the Cities in Motion Index from the IESE Business School has the best overall performance. To improve the versatility of the existing smart city indices, this paper proposes a new approach based on respecting three main criteria: refining the types of indicator, defining the smart city domains and adopting context-sensitive measurements. These elements are deemed to be essential for any smart city index.}

In this regard, fog computing, a robust cloud computing complement, plays a preponderant role by virtue of locating closer to the end-devices. Nonetheless, utilized approaches in smart cities are frequently cloud-based, which causes not only the security and time-sensitive services to suffer but also its flexibility and reliability to be restricted. In order to obviate the limitations of cloud and other related computing paradigms such as edge computing, this paper proposes a study for the state-of-the-art fog-based approaches in smart cities. Furthermore, according to the reviewed research content, a classification is proposed that falls into three classes: service-based, resource-based, and application-based. This study also investigates the evaluation factors, used tools, evaluation methods, merits, and demerits of each class. Types of proposed algorithms in each class are mentioned as well. Above all else, by taking various perspectives into account, comprehensive and distinctive open issues and challenges are provided via classifying future trends and issues into practical sub-classes.}

However, little is known about how these ideas are being translated into real policies and whether they are having a real impact. The objective of this paper is to understand how the smart approach is being deployed in the planning processes of Spanish tourist cities and destinations, and its implications in terms of the governance, sustainability and data-driven public management. The planning instruments that guide the smart strategies of different Spanish cities are identified and analysed. This is complemented with a questionnaire administered among managers of the smart city and smart destination initiatives. The findings reveal the diversity of smart initiatives, their benefits and limitations.

However, the data transmission and management of the internet of vehicles are heavily dependent on the wireless channel, which determines that the wireless channel is vulnerable to conceivable threats such as information leakage and data attack. Therefore, this paper proposes a security and privacy protection communication protocol for internet of vehicles in the smart cities. In terms of security, Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and Scyther formal verification tool are used for security verification. Through security analysis and performance analysis, this protocol has lower computation and communication costs while achieving higher security.}

abstract = {The notion of smart city is based on using both bidirectional power and data flows. For that, designing a persuasive control model for power flow becomes a big and crucial part in a smart city to optimize the power balance between production and consumption. So, a seven-layer smart city energy management strategy (SLSCEMS) for multiple home energy cooperation is presented in this paper. The optimised aims of this strategy are smoothing the smart homes power demand profiles, reducing the electricity bills (E.B), and gaining a total free charging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). This approach has been designed as hierarchic local and global layers. The first one is divided into three layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its own Renewable Energy sources (RES) and PEVs. The second one is split into four layers that aim to transfer the energy between each smart home and its PEVs, the neighboring homes and their RES, and the smart grid. All optimised layers are based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed strategy is evaluated in a city that contains one hundred homes classified into five categories, each category is designated by its power profile and its flexible number of RESs and PEVs. Simulation results show a decrease in the daily E.B of 26.24%, 2.42%, 60.33%, 29.51%, and 2.38% respectively of the five categories. So, these numerical results prove that the proposed SLSCEMS has considerable efficiency.}

Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.}

However, less attention has been given to the impact of Smart Cities construction on local entrepreneurial activity. This paper assesses the impact of Smart Cities construction on urban entrepreneurial activity using the difference-in-difference (DID) model based on panel data from 265 prefecture-level cities in China from 2002 to 2019. The empirical results show that Smart Cities policies significantly enhance urban entrepreneurial activity. After the parallel trend and placebo test, the estimation results based on the PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching-Difference in Difference) method are robust and consistent with the baseline regression results. The mechanism analyses indicate that the possible channels for Smart Cities policies to exert a positive impact on urban entrepreneurial activity are improving the city's ability to attract investment and enhancing technological innovation. Furthermore, Smart Cities policies have a more significant incentive effect on entrepreneurial activity in eastern regions, larger-scale cities, and cities with higher levels of service informatization and a larger scale of government financial expenditure. This paper contributes to the policy effects of Smart Cities pilots and the factors influencing entrepreneurial activity. This paper has important implications for enhancing entrepreneurial market dynamics and promoting urban transformation programs in developing countries to empower a sustained wave of urban entrepreneurship.}

To fill this gap, this study introduces a Happiness Driven Smart City (HDSC) mechanism to better guide the development of Smart City towards a more human-centered direction. HDSC mechanism includes a three-layer interrelated structure and is underpinned by a set of Strategic Measures. The assessment criteria have also been established for applying HDSC mechanism to investigate the performance of Smart City initiatives. The HDSC mechanism established in this study is a first attempt to assess the performance of Smart City development from the lens of human happiness. By applying HDSC mechanism in investigating Manchester's Smart City initiatives, the mechanism is proven effective to help decision makers understand the status quo of Smart City development in their urban context, based upon which the strength and weakness in the process of HDSC development can be drawn out. Consequently, Smart City blueprint can be better achieved towards a happiness-driven direction via dynamic assessment and adjustment.}

Unfortunately, these new technological implementations also entice adversaries and cybercriminals to execute cyber-attacks and commit criminal acts on these modern infrastructures. Given the borderless nature of cyber attacks, varying levels of understanding of smart city infrastructure and ongoing investigation workloads, law enforcement agencies and investigators would be hard-pressed to respond to these kinds of cybercrime. Without an investigative capability by investigators, these smart infrastructures could become new targets favored by cybercriminals. To address the challenges faced by investigators, we propose a common definition of smart city infrastructure. Based on the definition, we utilize the STRIDE threat modeling methodology and the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool to identify threats present in the infrastructure and create a threat model which can be further customized or extended by interested parties. Next, we map offences, possible evidence sources and types of threats identified to help investigators understand what crimes could have been committed and what evidence would be required in their investigation work. Finally, noting that Smart City Infrastructure investigations would be a global multi-faceted challenge, we discuss technical and legal opportunities in digital forensics on Smart City Infrastructure.}

Along with this trend, the problem with standardization of this concept appeared, which in this context means defining specific criteria for assessing the degree of introducing smart solutions to cities. Regarding the issue of measurable methods of assessing cities in terms of implementing the smart idea, it can be said that the existing works in this area usually present only values/levels that particular cities have achieved in specific criteria, on the basis of which rankings are then created. The indicators defined for the purpose of such estimates, however, give neither a picture of their initial conditions, with which particular cities started their development, nor their perspectives for the development. The solution to the described problem may be an assessment methodology in which, in addition to static indicators, dynamic or derivative indicators are being computed and assessed. The proposed dynamic indicators tell about the rate of progress or the regression in particular assessment categories. This approach, to a certain extent, shows the innovation and efforts made by particular cities towards introducing the smart idea.}

To explore this dynamic, we conducted a sentiment analysis of tweets regarding four smart city projects in Africa using the NRC Emotion Lexicon. The analysis revealed strong and consistent positive associations with words annotated with the emotions of Anticipation, Trust, and Joy. Based on these cross-case trends, we speculate that given their underwhelming outputs, the larger smart city agenda and its accompanying strategic positive framing have contrived a potentially pervasive and illusionary sentiment of “smart city mirages” among the public consciousness.}

However, the widespread use of IoT applications in smart cities has resulted in security and privacy concerns that must be addressed to protect sensitive data. To safeguard smart cities from cyber attacks, learning theory-based automated attack-detection methods must be adopted. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to create effective models for identifying IoT attacks. However, the majority of IoT detection algorithms have focused on only a few types of IoT attacks, and most IoT threat detection systems have used black-box deep learning models that lack interpretability to support their forecasts. This research aims to detect several types of large-scale attacks on IoT devices using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost) classifier and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches. The proposed method not only improves the model’s performance but also increases trust in the model. The results of the experimental study on the IOTD20 dataset and XAI evaluation of each feature’s contribution to the model demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently identify malicious attacks and threats, reducing IoT cybersecurity threats in smart cities.}

abstract = {Smart cities are expected to address global challenges and increase the quality of life. However, due to the overemphasis on physical and technological aspects, social rights and democratic values have often been neglected in smart city projects. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ‘societal smart city’ and discuss how and why it should be prioritized in the post-pandemic era. We argue that a societal smart city is a city that integrates social rights and democratic values with technological innovations. Six major dimensions of a societal smart city are: social sustainability, citizen-centeredness, e-democracy, social justice, participatory governance, and cultural resilience. We encourage urban planners and policymakers to pay attention to these dimensions and caution against physical and technological determinism.}

These problems cannot be solved with the traditional urban understanding as not meet the needs of modern people. Solving the main problems encountered in cities with science and technology approach brings us the concept of smart city. Today, it has become inevitable to offer citizen-oriented solutions to urban problems in order to ensure a sustainable environment for high level of welfare/public health and to manage the effective and correct use of resources. In this review, environmental problems that can be encountered in any city are classified under four main headings as water, waste, air and traffic, and approaches that can be applied in smart city management for the solution of these problems encountered in traditional cities are emphasized in the light of studies in literature, by considering the main environmental problems encountered in cities. Thus, smart methods based solutions are presented against basic problems such as water/wastewater management, waste management, air pollution control and effective transportation encountered in a city.}

Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.}

Consequently, definitions of the terms “smart city” and “IoT framework” need to be condensed, consolidating concepts and guidelines of smart cities and IoT frameworks, as will be shown in this study. In addition, a systematic survey of IoT frameworks for smart city applications is presented, summarizing and comparing the technologies and architectures of IoT frameworks for smart city applications. As a result of this study, trends in IoT frameworks for smart city applications and a definition of the term “smart city” are provided. Materializing the findings achieved in this study, an abstract IoT framework concept for smart city applications is proposed. It is expected that the definition of the term “smart city” may be used as a basis for a generally accepted formal definition and that the proposed IoT framework concept may provide a strong foundation for successful IoT framework implementations in the context of smart city applications.}

Since there are lots of interactions between the cyber layer and the physical layer, the operation, management, and security of the entire system are crucial topics that must be taken into account. In this regard, this paper tackles two problems in AC MGs, as a special case of smart cities. Firstly, a framework is proposed to solve the optimal scheduling problem in these systems. In this stage, the optimal management and scheduling of the system are structured and modeled as an optimization problem. The dragonfly is utilized as a powerful optimization technique to solve this optimization problem. It is worth noting that in this paper different renewable energy sources, as well as batteries are considered. Since cyber-attacks are among the greatest threats to the system and can cause disruption and outage in smart grids, in this paper a deep-learning-based method called long short-term memory along with the concept of prediction interval is utilized to develop a cyber-attack detection model for false data injection attacks on smart meters. The proposed cyber-attack detection model is first trained using historical data and then is used in real-time for detection. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal scheduling scheme, the modified IEEE 33-bus test system is utilized. Also, for testing the proposed cyber-attack detection model a real-world dataset is used. The simulation results show the great performance and effectiveness of both proposed methodologies. It should be noted that all model are simulated in digital twin simulator. The novel LSTM-based cyber-attack detection model enhances security in electric grids, demonstrating remarkable accuracy.}

Happiness reflecting citizens’ quality of life could be the gateway to sustainability, but few studies incorporated it into smart city planning. This paper clarifies the correlations between smart cities and urban happiness. The analyses show that the smart environment associated with green spaces, air pollution control, and recycling services significantly influences happiness. Moreover, improving urban infrastructure thoroughly is more critical for increasing well-being and livability than providing technical products for end users. Finally, different geographically gathered cities would face different challenges in maintaining happiness, including local (e.g., housing and population density) and global (e.g., the North-South divide) issues. Urban planners and governments must understand local and cultural contexts while cultivating global visions to identify cities’ actual needs and achieve sustainable development goals.}

Part of this is digitalization, with the main goal being the implementation of a smart city district digital ecosystem providing digital solutions to the people of the district, which is currently still under construction. So far, we have already developed some digital solutions with different technology readiness levels. One major question we have faced, however, was how to inform the public about these solutions. We decided to do this in various ways, such as a classical project webpage, events, and videos. In order to have one main entry point for the public to explore our solutions, we have developed a so-called ecosystem map. Four of the digital solutions are presented there to show what kind of digital solutions might be part of the future smart city district digital ecosystem. In this paper, we report on how we created the digital map, provide the four digital solution examples shown on the map, and present initial feedback we received regarding our solutions.}

Although different smart city (SC) classifications exist, these classifications are not always balanced, with some of them placing an emphasis on ICTs and infrastructure, while others prioritize social performance of cities and their physical environment. In this study, we suggest a relatively simple SC ranking system, based on two basic principles – direct relevance to human welfare and equal representation of key dimensions of sustainability. The proposed assessment system, composed of nine quantitative metrics, is applied to 100+ major cities worldwide, helping us to identify the best and the worst SC performers. As the study also reveals, there are clear regional differences in the interpretation components and underlying dimensions of SCs with an emphasis on “economy and technology” in North America, “the environment” in Europe, and “society” in Asia.}

Considering that, due to multiple environmental and societal pressures, land use, has become more political than ever, whereby pleas for open and transparent methods of coordination, deliberation, and participation proliferate, it is imperative that citizens are involved in the land use policymaking at the level of the city and the neighborhoods. Even if substantial literature addressing each of these issues exists, approaches that would fit these multiple pieces of the puzzle together in one equation are still missing. By elaborating on the findings of an online survey (N = 5752) involving the citizens of a smart city (Lublin, Poland), this paper responds to this imperative. The findings suggest that utilizing insights from e-participation tools and surveys, in combination with more traditional instruments, such as meetings, debates, and workshops, may significantly improve land use policies in (smart) cities.}

We identified five dynamic capabilities that effectively contribute to smart city transformation: seizing, sensing, innovation, integrative, and empowering capability. Our analysis also reveals that a city administration's organizational readiness plays a critical role in these transformative processes and relies on four factors: innovation readiness, resource readiness, a participatory and collective mindset, and strategic readiness. Based on our findings, we suggest a theoretical framework composed of 10 propositions that describe the mutual influences of these dynamic managerial capabilities and organizational readiness factors, together with their contributions to smart city transformation. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and the implications for future research and practice.}

In the past, the goal of a smart city was to build urban infrastructure. However, the current focus is on providing smart city services. Thus, the operation and maintenance of smart city services are becoming more important than building them. Secondly, the manner in which companies secure smart city services has become diverse. As such, companies may be classified into those that secure the entire value chain of smart cities and those that own only some smart city services. Thirdly, companies are actively establishing a cooperative system to secure smart city technology. Rather than developing all the required technology, they demonstrate flexibility in responding to various smart city needs by collaborating with companies that provide individual services.}

abstract = {Cities of the 21st century are buffeted with challenges, leaving potentially serious consequences on the future of urban living. Smartening development in cities has reinvented hopes of melting down predicaments in the early 2000s'. However, perplexed by the intensifying complexities of smart cities, urban living in smart cities needs to be evaluated with multiple conflicting criteria. Multi-criteria-based evaluations have been an answer to this case when attempting to gauge the composite performance of multiple decision-making entities. Several multi-criteria assessment techniques exist when dealing with selection problems. Nonetheless, the vagueness associated with the methodologies accompanied by uncertainties and complexities is inevitable in multi-attribute assessments. Fuzzy-based multi-criteria models are often an answer to such uncertainties when modelling real-world problems. The study thus presents a novel fuzzy expert-based multi-criteria decision support model, where the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is combined with the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) approach under a spherical fuzzy environment to create a composite index for comprehensive performance monitoring. The case of 35 high-tech European cities was used to empirically validate the proposed novel approach and thus construct a composite index. The composite index considers the intricate facet of integrating the concept of smart cities with sustainability, urban resilience, and livability under a unified framework. The fuzzy c-means partitioning technique was then used to segment smart cities into high, medium, and low-performing classes. A comparative analysis considering several distance-based approaches under a fuzzy environment with the SF-AHP and EDAS methodology is conducted to validate the robustness and stability of the proposed novel decision support model. The results revealed London as the top-ranked smart city that promotes sustainability, resilience, and livability in its current urban development model. Dusseldorf, Zurich, Munich, Oslo, Dublin, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Moscow, and Stockholm were no exemption from addressing the tritactic goals of sustainability, urban resilience, and livability well into their urban development plan and were placed in the high-performance cluster. The proposed model is efficient to express decision makers' preferences in a larger space and modelling functional parameters including hesitancy independently in the 3-dimensional domain. The model supports decision-makers and relocation analysts to assess the performance of smart cities and set targets to improve performance to remodel urban development to a more sustainable, resilient, and livable pattern.}

Then, we adopt a contingency approach to unpack the factors that affect the intensity of collaboration between the stakeholders in the smart city ecosystem. To characterize the ecosystem, we use the quadruple-helix framework. Through the perspective of the local government, we derive hypotheses on whether certain factors lead to more intensive collaboration, which are tested on a sample of Belgian municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of smart city strategies for intensifying collaboration between the local government and stakeholders in the ecosystem. Moreover, we also find that for large ecosystems, a smart city manager or department may facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders. Taken together, our findings indicate that there are certain configurational approaches to increasing collaboration in smart cities, which will depend on the context of a city.}

In the context of smart cities, innovative solutions have been required, especially to improve the local government's capacity to manage health crises. This study asks whether smart cities perform better in governing the COVID-19 pandemic. This article focuses on how urban governance impacted cities’ performance in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a city-level data set from Indonesia, we constructed a COVID-19 response performance index using principal component analysis that is used in an empirical strategy with quasi-experimental cross-sectional methods to minimize the influence of unobserved covariates and selection bias. This study concludes that smart city status does not have a statistically significant impact on the COVID-19 performance index. We offer three possible accounts based on expert insights, previous empirical studies, and digital upshots on data monitoring and reporting cases. Both theoretical and practical implications can be drawn, thus highlighting the lack of effective integration of technological dimensions into health and urban governance systems in the context of a public health crisis.}
