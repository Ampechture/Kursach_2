abstract = {A multi-objective problem, namely, dynamic economic emission dispatch is simultaneously solved under several practical equality and inequality operating power constraints, while applying the load demand management (LDM) on 30,000 electric vehicles (EVs) during crest shaving and valley filling (CSVF) regions. A novel algorithm named orthogonal particle swarm optimization (OPSO) is proposed for such a problem. Ten thermal-generating units (TGUs) from power-generating systems (PGSs) in two Case Studies, with and without LDM on the load demand of 30,000 EVs, are tested. The comprehensive analysis results reveal that the quantity of emissions released by the 10 TGUs was remarkable affected and reduced around 4005 kg/day and the operating fuel cost was saved around $409/day when applying the LDM on the load demand of 30,000 EVs in the CSVF regions. This study provides important outcomes about the future operation of PGSs when applying the LDM strategy on a large-scale penetration of EVs in smart cities into a sustainable environment. The study outcomes contribute in making the PGS flexible, economical, environmental, stable, and reliable.}

The smart city as a platform presents an obvious opportunity for growth, but the status of business through the next evolutionary stage of systems change is not certain. This transformation requires diverse strategies and business models that will enable an equitable path forward to accelerate the critically needed convergence of the natural, human and technological systems. This will help create more sustainable cities and slow the global entropy taking place, while at the same time provide a space for a higher quality of life for all citizens. Competition is part of the driving force between nations and cities and must be factored in as part of the equation. New business models incorporating commons-based economics and planetary accounting practices, utilizing technologies including blockchain and holochain across all business channels and formats from P2P to G2G, will secure the potential to develop equitable and sustainable supply chain ecosystems on global and local scales that will further enable convergence. The concept of Flow in the context of smart city operating systems is the ultimate harnessing of collective intelligence and resource optimization, bringing technology to the highest state of realization.}

With the rise in automobile manufacturing and the frequency of vehicle crashes, human catastrophes, like fatalities, accidents, impairments, and destruction of property, are surging yearly. Vehicle collision detection has recently gained prominence in decreasing manually operated and autonomous vehicle fatalities. The concept of independent and self-driving cars relies on accurate object recognition, including pedestrians, vehicles, buildings, and other moving objects. Various object-detecting approaches have been proposed to help autonomous vehicles (AVs) achieve consistent, safe driving. Object prediction and detection have noticed numerous algorithmic changes that have improved speed and accuracy. In this study, I used a traffic dataset produced by a CARLA simulator to anticipate collisions using the Yolov7 model. I generated the dataset from a CARLA simulation bench in video sequences, manually annotated the frames, and used the deep learning algorithm Yolov7 to train them. The model predicts the collision a few seconds before it occurs in real-time. I implemented this framework to increase the safety of driving in self-driving vehicles.}

We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children’s learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly.}

Smart cities can provide innovative solutions in various domains such as environment, economy, mobility, and safety with technology as enabler. However, this is only possible if the citizens, the end users, are involved in the design of the smart city. The aim of this chapter is to provide a repository of methods and useful guidelines to manage citizen participation in the design of smart cities. By means of a literature review from different research areas and an analysis of concrete and well-established smart cities, the relevant methods of citizen participation are identified and described. These methods are bundled into three categories: citizens as democratic participants, citizens as cocreators, and citizens as information and communication technology users. Furthermore, we present the CitiVoice Framework, a management tool for decision-makers to manage citizen participation that we apply in the context of three Belgian smart cities (Mons, Namur, Brussels). This framework builds on the identified participation methods and has three different uses: (1) as an evaluation tool allowing drawbacks and flaws in citizens' participation to be discovered and analyzed; (2) as a governance tool to help define the citizen participation strategy; and (3) as a comparison and creativity tool to compare several cities and design new means of participation.}

In this paper, a new enhanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm is introduced for adjusting the orientation of Pan–Tilt–Zoom (PTZ) surveillance cameras in new Cairo. In other words, the new proposed algorithm is used for improving the field of view (FOV) coverage of PTZ cameras network. For validating the proposed algorithm, it is tested on many scenarios with different criterions. After that, the proposed algorithm is applied to adjust the PTZ monitoring cameras in the green river which locates on new administrative capital as an equivalent to the river Nile. In addition, it compared with several other AI algorithms through the appropriate statistical analysis. The overall experimental results indicate the prosperity of the proposed algorithm for increasing the coverage of the PTZ surveillance system.}

Thus, we address this literature gap by conducting structural topic modelling on smart city projects retrieved from the Smart Territory call for projects. In these projects, city managers' report extensively on how smart urban technologies can support urban sustainability. Our results show nine groups of smart urban technologies that will support at least two urban sustainability dimensions. Smart mobility systems can support all three dimensions of urban sustainability. Technology benefits will be realised by smart urban technology capabilities and through the involvement of the city's community in the use of technology.}

Our original approach, called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights in order to avoid traffic jams by using V2I communications. That is quite different from other existing proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to optimize our case studies which have been imported from OpenStreetMap into SUMO as they belong to a real city. We have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best results, but also outperformed the experts’ solutions in a total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19% shorter travel times.}

The use of wireless sensor networks to monitor indoor temperature is a typical application in smart cities. Rather than splitting the measured temperature and the design of a sensor network, a cyber-physical design approach is proposed by this paper for indoor temperature monitoring using wireless sensor network. The source sensors adopt sleep/wake scheduling, that is, source nodes wake up and sense the temperature periodically. The temperature data is sent to the cloud server via multi-hop relaying sensor nodes in an anycast way. Each sensor decides how to route packets based on its local information and dynamically adjust the sleep/wake duty cycle according to the sensed temperature: if the measured temperature is within normal range, the sensor wakes up infrequently to achieve higher energy efficiency; and vice versa. We first propose an optimal delay algorithm for anycast protocol. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms other heuristic schemes. Furthermore, we implement the proposed algorithm using TelosB sensors with TinyOS. Experiments demonstrate that the designed system can report a temperature anomaly within a small delay and achieve good long-term energy efficiency at the same time.}

The second one is the use of knowledge to drive the economy at different levels and dimensions. The third one is the use of knowledge to secure efficient governance. In this context, the key question is what are the implications of efficient knowledge sharing for the governance of smart cities? In this context, the key question is how a shared knowledge could be linked with general purposes of a governance with respect to the SDGs in the EU Agenda. In this continuous growth of knowledge process, the stakeholders’ logics to produce strategic choices remain strictly depending on three basic principles, i.e., equity, efficiency, and sustainability, controlled through indicators. This chapter investigates the ways and methods of collecting and utilizing chunks of knowledge as they stem from physical laws, written law, best practices, or from data analytics. In this process the stakeholders’ logic, based on three basic principles equity, efficiency, and sustainability through indicators, has to be maintained. Applications in urban planning are presented to show how knowledge can be encoded and shared to improve the efficiency of governance in smart cities.}

Unattended supervision and data acquisition are the primary requirements of any smart city project which is fulfilled by wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the rigorous and rapidly changing metropolis tends to make the network unreliable. Reliability in the data is achieved through the application of fault tolerant protocols. All the literatures use the robust cluster-head (CH) as the basis for the protocol. This is unrealistic and could lead to unintended consequences upon CH node failure. In this paper, we propose a rational dynamic CH scheme, where the CH is prone to errors just like other nodes in the network. The LEACH protocol is modified to incorporate smart dynamic CH selection at the end of each round based on the residual energy and sensor readings. This ensures minimal energy waste and consolidates a green model for smart cities. An efficient dissemination scheme is proposed to facilitate the attainment of global view of the network among all the CHs at the end of r rounds. The proposed protocol gives better classification accuracy and reduced false alarm rates for varied probabilities of intermittent and permanent faults as compared to LEACH.}

abstract = {The capability approach developed by the Nobel Prize Amartya Sen have influenced the theoretical approaches of the studies of well-being and quality of life in a multidimensional key focusing on people's freedom. As Sen points out that approach measures the individual advantage in the reason of the capability that the person has to do those things which assign a value. In fact, the advantage of an individual in terms of opportunities is considered lower than that of another one if that individual has lower capacities – i.e. lower effective opportunities - to realize what he attributes a value. The focus is than on the effective freedom of people to do or to be what he believes is worthwhile to do or to be (Sen A., 1999). Therefore, Sen proposes an idea of well-being as “what the individual can do or can be” (set of being and doing), in relation to the ability of people to transform the means and the resources available in results, achievements and goals. A proposal that aims to overcome the concept of material well-being, limited to the unique availability of resources. Furthermore, the capability approach allows a rereading of the issue of the quality of life associated with the condition of social segregation in urban areas, namely degradation of the peripheral neighbourhoods of the city. The urban environment, being a factor capable of affecting the ability to act of people, for the presence/absence of social structures in the broadest possible sense, can be evaluated for the opportunities given to individuals to convert their resources into daily life functioning. The capabilities of people can become, therefore, a measure of the quality of urban environment, depending on the wealth of the conversion factors of the resources into the set of capability. The different multidimensional perspective, introduced by the capability approach, can decisively influence the policy choices. The development of the smart cities strategies and, more generally, the “integrated” territorial policies should propose, then, as an expansion of the devices of people capabilities, in urban areas, which could become potentially segregating and narrowing the field of opportunities to convert resources into functioning.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is an emerging area of interest, and this can be used to obtain knowledge and take better decisions in the same Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT data are prone to anomalies due to various factors such as malfunctioning of sensors, low-cost devices, etc. Following the AIoT paradigm, this work explores anomaly detection in IoT urban noise sensor networks using a Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoder. Two autoencoder models are trained using normal data from two different sensors in the sensor network and tested for the detection of two different types of anomalies, i.e. point anomalies and collective anomalies. The results in terms of accuracy of the two models are 99.99% and 99.34%. The trained model is quantised, converted to TensorFlow Lite format and deployed on the ESP32 microcontroller (MCU). The inference time on the microcontroller is 4 ms for both models, and the power consumption of the MCU is 0.2693 W ± 0.039 and 0.3268 W ± 0.015. Heap memory consumption during the execution of the program for sensors TA120-T246187 and TA120-T246189 is 528 bytes and 744 bytes respectively.}

For practical purposes, however, it is useful to conceive a general framework to characterize cities as composed of a certain number of dimensions, each dimension referring to a set of desired functions or services. For any given city, the set of dimensions will provide an objective means to evaluate its current situation and to plan future actions. Based upon the published characteristics of other city definitions, and upon practical implementations of the workshop methodology presented in Chapter 6, Where and How to Start in Your City, this chapter details a set of eight dimensions to characterize more humane, sustainable, and smart cities, with practical examples of planned actions in several instances.}

Photovoltaics (PV) seems to be one of the most suitable energy generation technologies for enabling this change, thanks to its “fair” cost, technical features, and multifunctional use in the building's envelope, as well as in the urban environment. PV will be an indispensable technology for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NetZEBs), with the consequence of being a kind of “ubiquitous” technology, also suitable for added uses than the traditional ones. For example: in addition to the multifunctional use in the building's envelope, it might offer advanced services for improving the efficiency and participation in the city processes. A multidisciplinary investigation on possible ways for PV and NetZEBs to change the future urban scenario is proposed, focusing on design, energy management and technological issues to support a Smart City (SC) vision.}

When ‘smart’ information and communication technologies (ICT) are introduced to cities, they open up new energy-related possibilities, risks, and uncertainties. This chapter discusses how we can begin to address challenges posed by the spread of ICT into everyday city life. It first considers city evolution and what a ‘smart city’ might offer in terms of management, environmental outcomes, and quality of life. Next, some relevant lessons from energy studies are reviewed. ICT-enabled energy systems in smart(er) cities offer new opportunities for decentralised energy but pose challenges about affordable energy services, security and privacy, control, accountability, and resilience. To achieve good environmental, energy, and social outcomes, we need to start from local characteristics and needs for energy services, actors, knowledge, and skills.}

These dichotomies suggest divergent hypotheses on what principles need to be considered when implementing strategies for enabling smart city development. This generates a critical knowledge gap that this chapter starts filling by reporting on the findings of a multiple case study analysis that is conducted into European best practices. The validity of the hypotheses emerging from each dichotomy is tested by analyzing four European cities considered to be leaders in the field of smart city development. The results of this best practice analysis offer critical insight into what strategic principles drive smart city development in Europe and generate scientific knowledge that helps to start overcoming the dichotomous nature of smart city research.}

It finds that neighborhood residents are potentially the most significant actors and hosts of smart spatial attributes. The mechanism emerges through people's diverse and technologically mediated interactions. At the neighborhood scale, the everyday urban smart neighborhood is produced via individuals' socializing and the sharing of information about events. Smart neighborhoods are facilitated and sustained by relatively practical and simple technologies, and their making is more an approach for improving the quality of urban life than a designated goal to achieve. This research concludes that residents' digital placemaking plays a significant role in developing lived smart cities. Three main implementation directions are proposed.}

abstract = {What are the relationships that exist between Information and Communication technologies (ICT)-enabled citizen-government collaboration and sustainable urban development? And, how do contextual circumstances influence these relationships? This chapter is focused on answering the preceding questions in four phases. The first phase of the chapter covers how smart governance, in the sense of ICT-enabled government-citizen collaboration to advance urban sustainability, is still rare; despite the fact of increasing a variety of collaboration-based digital instruments and the dominance of a one way information supply in citizen-government interactions. In other words, although governments promote online and offline citizen engagement and civic empowerment, in practice, they do not encourage deliberation or any broad based public-civil interactions. Therefore, ICT-supported government-citizen cooperation for collectively shaping public matters seldom occurs. Second, this chapter explains why the evidence that smart governance contributes to sustainability is sparse and mixed. The second phase also explains why smart governance activities lead to more livable cities–cities with less social deprivation, more ecological diversity, and enhanced economic prosperity. The third phase of the chapter covers why there is more evidence for the process effects of smart governance. In other words, this phase focuses on the solitary–particularly the social aspects, instead of assessing the sustainability in its integrated economic, social, and environmental outcomes. Finally, the fourth phase of the chapter concludes as to why context matters: We identified specific contextual factors such as the policy domain, political-institutional (e.g., democracy, innovation, administration styles), societal (e.g., Internet reach and use in the society, trust), and socio-spatial (e.g., topography of the city, local-specific social cohesion) dimensions. These contextual factors influence the distinct components of smart governance (the role of governments and citizens as well as ICT use); and, define how local governments and citizens collaborate through new electronic resources--which in turn, determine the potential of advancing urban sustainability.}

We have developed a system that enables wheelchair users to interact with items placed beyond their arm’s length, with the help of Augmented Reality (AR) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. Our proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing autonomy in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and development of the system. The evaluation results show promising results towards more independence of wheelchair users, providing an opportunity for equality improvement.}

abstract = {In the near future, a technological revolution will involve our cities, where a variety of smart services based on the Internet of Things will be developed to facilitate the needs of the citizens. Sensing devices are already being deployed in urban environments, and they will generate huge amounts of data. Such data is typically outsourced to some cloud service in order to lower capital and operating expenses and guarantee high availability. However, cloud services may suffer from data breaches due to software and hardware vulnerabilities, or they may have incentives to release stored data to unauthorized entities. In this work we present ABE-Cities, an encryption system for urban sensing which solves the above problems while ensuring fine-grained access control on data by means of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). ABE-Cities senses data from the city and stores it on the cloud in an encrypted form. Then, it provides users with keys able to decrypt only data sensed from authorized paths or zones of the city. In ABE-Cities, sensors perform only lightweight symmetric-key encryption, thus we can employ constrained sensor devices such as battery powered motes. ABE-Cities allows us to plan an expiration date for each key, as well as to revoke a given key in an unplanned fashion. We prove that ABE-Cities scales well with the number of users and the number of streets by simulating it with 30 000 users on the Beijing street network, which consists of more than 30 000 streets. In addition to the “vanilla” ABE-Cities scheme, we propose an “advanced” one that leverages the presence of IoT gateways to reduce the computational load otherwise weighing on a single Trusted Third Party. We validate this by testing the advanced scheme on the simulated Houston and Beijing street networks.}

At the same time, Software-defined technology is also widely used in sensor-based devices. These sensor-based devices can get new functions and become smarter by updating their software. These sensor-based devices can be called smart sensors because they can generate smart data (which means filter out the noise and hold the valuable data). These smart sensors can adapt to the needs of new applications and form smart software-defined IoTs. However, it is a huge challenging issue that disseminating the update code to the smart sensors that are widespread and large quantity. We found that there are hundreds and thousands of mobile vehicles moving in the city, which can be used as the code mules to disseminate code with low cost. In this paper, a novel low-cost code dissemination model is proposed which disseminate the update code by using the mobile vehicles in the city with an opportunistic communication style. In order to improve the performance of such code dissemination model, a coverage based greedy deployment scheme for code stations and an optimized code selection algorithm are proposed to maximize coverage of code dissemination over the city with low cost and duration time. Extensive simulation experiments validate the proposed code dissemination model is feasible and indicate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes by using a real taxi trajectory dataset.}

Our methods are leveraging on non-electrical cooling devices such as thermal storage and heat pumps for waste heat reuse and IT workload execution time shifting and spatial relocation in federated DCs. To trade energy flexibility we have defined an Energy Marketplace which allows DCs to act as active energy players integrated into the smart grid, contributing to smart city-level efficiency goals. Reinforcing this vision, we have proposed four innovative business scenarios that enable next generation smart Net-zero Energy DCs acting as energy prosumers at the interface with smart energy grids within smart city environments. Simulation experiments are conducted to determine the DCs potential electrical and thermal energy flexibility in meeting various network level goals and to assess the financial viability of the defined business scenarios. The results show that DCs have a significant amount of energy flexibility which may be shifted and traded to interested stakeholders thus allowing them to gain new revenue streams not foreseen before.}

To address the challenges in this new network scenario, we propose to opportunistically rely on the increasing number of connected vehicles in densely populated urban areas. The idea is to support the macro base station (BS) with a secondary communication tier composed of a set of smart and connected vehicles that are in movement in the urban area. As a first step towards a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this architecture, this paper considers the case where these vehicles are equipped with femto-mobile access points (fmAPs) and constitute a mobile out-of-band relay infrastructure. We first study this network system with a continuous time model, in which three techniques to select an fmAP (if more than one is available) are proposed and the maximal feasible gain in the data rate is characterized as a function of the vehicle density, average vehicle speeds, handoff overhead cost, as well as physical layer parameters. We then introduce a time slotted model, in which we consider a more realistic communication channel, with an exponential path loss model, and we investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and expected data rate, as a function of the system parameters. The analytical and simulation results, with both the continuous and time slotted models, provide a first benchmark characterizing this architecture and the definition of guidelines for its future realistic study and implementation.}

abstract = {Connected and automated mobility systems can revolutionize the movement of both people and goods. Numerous studies call for the rapid adoption of connected and automated vehicle technologies that will be capable of improving safety significantly and supporting the unprecedented future demand. Several global smart city initiatives have shown that cities prosper when infrastructures are connected seamlessly. Interconnections of information systems are now occurring in ways never previously imagined, with potentially dramatic outcomes. Growing demand due to population and economic growth, coupled with a lack of adequate transportation policies and investment, are overwhelming transportation systems. Without substantial technological progress supported by policy and investments, the transportation systems will face a “drifting toward gridlock” scenario, as it is already the case in many major urban centers around the world. In this chapter, we first present an overview of connected and automated mobility systems, including connected and automated vehicles, transportation infrastructure, transportation data, and several brief field reports. Second, we have presented policies and guidance on safety, communication, cooperative driving automation, cybersecurity and privacy, and navigation systems (GPS/GNSS) for connected and automated mobility. Third, we have covered policies for connected and automated mobility services and parking and land use. Finally, legislation and public perception are presented for improving user acceptance for new technologies such as connected and automated mobility systems.}

In this framework the municipality devoted specific internal expertise to develop and manage the program autonomously, involving the other partners during the operative and executive phases. The chapter assesses and analyzes the ongoing and planned relevant experiences to establish a long-term structural “smart” planning framework in the city and analyzes, for the first time, the performance of the “city smartness” making use of the methodology provided by the World Council of City Data. In the future, it is suggested to include ideas and actions into the program within 2030 and beyond, which may provide higher awareness about the impacts of long-term measures and policies, supporting better decision-making.}

Using this framework, the existing infrastructure system can be prescreened on a large scale to determine the key infrastructure elements that exhibit abnormal behavior before implementing more detailed on-site monitoring systems or conducting detailed site inspections on individual infrastructure elements. In this framework, a large amount of crowdsensing data, i.e., “big data,” is collected from commercial-grade sensors in mobile personal devices, e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles, and cameras. In order for such crowdsensing-based frameworks to succeed, the crowdsensing data must be efficiently and effectively managed and analyzed to support decision-making. In this context, this chapter presents a software platform to analyze and manage the crowdsensing data collected from moving vehicles. The platform includes a database to store the crowdsensing data, algorithms that are integrated for data analysis, and a web-based interactive system for visualization. Three algorithms developed by our group that can process vibration and image data collected from moving vehicles for bridge and road condition assessment are presented in this chapter, which are Mel-frequency cepstral analysis-based methods for bridge damage detection, inverse filter-based method bridge frequency identification, and deep learning-based method for road crack detection. In the long term, we envision that this platform will be open-sourced, and more algorithms that can process other crowdsensing data can be integrated in this platform in the future.}

A deep learning architecture of power management (DLA-PM) is presented in this article. It predicts future power consumption for a short period and provides effective communication between power distributors and customers. To keep power consumption and supply constant, mobile devices are linked to a universal IoT cloud server connected to the intelligent grids in the proposed design. An effective brief forecast decision-making method is followed by various preprocessing strategies to deal with electrical data. It conducts extensive tests with RMSE reduced by 0.08 for both residential and business data sources. Significant strengths include refined device-based, real-time energy administration via a shared cloud-based server data monitoring system, optimized selection of standardization technology, a new energy prediction framework, a learning process with decreased time, and lower error rates. In the proposed architecture, mobile devices link to a universal IoT cloud server communicating with the corresponding intelligent grids such that the power consumption and supply phenomena continually continue. It utilizes many preprocessing strategies to cope with the diversity of electrical data, follows an effective short prediction decision-making method, and executes it using resources.

We had previously developed a technology known as Smart Accident Precognition System (SAPS) which reduces the rate of accidents in automobile and also enhance the safety of the passengers. Current research advances this technique by integrating Google Assistant with the SAPS. The proposed system integrates several embedded devices in the automobiles that monitor various aspects such as speed, distance, safety measures like seatbelt, door locks, airbags, handbrakes etc. The real-time data is stored in the cloud and the vehicle can adapt to various situations from the previous data collected. Also, with the Google Assistant user can lock and unlock, start and stop, alert and do various automated tasks such as low fuel remainder, insurance remainders etc. The proposed IoT enabled real-time vehicle system can detect accidents and adapt to change according to various conditions. Further, with RFID keyless entry authentication the vehicle is secure than ever before. This proposed system is much efficient to the existing systems and will have a great positive impact in the automobile industry and society.}

In this study, a comprehensive review on sustainable airport energy ecosystems with hydrogen-based renewable-grid-storage-flexibility, has been conducted, from perspectives of airport energy ecosystem constitutions, renewable supported power supply chain, novel spatiotemporal energy migration paradigms, single and multi-objective optimisations, together with multi-criteria decision-making approaches. Hydrogenation in jet aircraft systems has various advantages, such as lightweight with low fuel transportation load, high specific energy, zero CO2 emissions, and low NOx emissions, reduced air pollution, and environmental sustainability. Depending on different energy sources, liquid hydrogen (LH2) can be produced by solar energy, wind energy, coastal ocean energy, and bioenergy, through chemical technologies and water electrolysis from renewable power. Synergistic operation between land and air transportation systems can promote net-zero emissions. Novel energy interaction frameworks have been formulated, for inter-city/inter-country energy sharing and trading, spatiotemporal compensation on uneven distributed renewable energy resources, and high penetration of renewables. Results showed that power characteristics in airport energy systems include lightweight, high-energy density, energy-intensive, fast power response, safety, stochastic, nonlinear, and dynamics. Coastal energy resources are full of huge potentials to support airport energy systems, through off-shore wind turbines, floating PV panels, current turbines, wave energy converters, tidal stream generators, and ocean thermo-electric generators. Research results can provide conceptional frameworks, prospects, and technical challenges, on electrification and hydrogenation in both land and air transportation sectors, paving path for transition towards sustainability and carbon neutrality.}

SMART is a decision-making model that aims to assess and promote liveability by placing it at the core of smart cities—delivering individual and societal wellbeing, resource security and efficiency, and planetary wellbeing. SMART can therefore be used by city leaders to support decision-making toward truly smart cities. The chapter describes Strand One of SMART: the analysis of documented initiatives filtered through four liveability lenses (societal, environmental, economic, and governance). Initiatives are explored as to whether they deliver direct and indirect impacts in support of actions that aim to deliver liveability, their timescale, and their reach in terms of impact on the local population. In support of this research a high-level analysis shows the number of primary impacts (direct) and secondary impacts (indirect) from Singapore’s smart initiatives, and importantly where an action toward liveability is not impacted at all.}

We present a feasible solution for the non-trivial problem of planning routes, guaranteeing 100% coverage of the 19.000km of roads in the Region and having hard computational time constrains. The solution is a combination of applied graph theory and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), framed into a realistic context to be able to carry out the project. One of the future foreseen application fields of cellular networks is to provide efficient network connectivity to cyber physical systems for the required data transactions between the devices and data processing units. Hence, the results derived from similar measurement projects, among many others, is the evaluation of whether the broadband infrastructure is currently ready for the deployment of Smart City outdoor cyber physical systems and implicitly, which steps should be taken towards the deployment of these systems.}

In most cases, wireless sensor networks need to be monitored in complex environments or in areas that humans cannot reach. Most of the nodes will adopt aircraft throwing and other methods, resulting in uncontrollable node positions. Such research cannot be carried out without knowing the specific source of the information. Therefore, the problem of node location in wireless sensor networks has become one of the key issues that must be solved. In this paper, a wireless sensor network topology based on correlation neighbor graph is constructed. The DV-Hop (Distance Vector-Hop) localization algorithm with hop number correction and average hop weighting is proposed. The signal strength value received by the node is converted into the distance between the nodes by the shadowing model; and the ratio of the distance value to the communication radius between the nodes is used to correct the hop value. In order to further improve the positioning performance of the algorithm, the MDV-Hop (Modified Distance Vector-Hop) algorithm is proposed. The MDV-Hop algorithm mainly improves the error caused by the number of hops between anchor nodes, the average hop distance and the network topology in the DV-Hop algorithm. Aiming at the problems of the maximum likelihood coordinate calculation method, the localization problem of nodes is transformed into the minimum problem of solving nonlinear equations, and the improved Bat algorithm is used to replace the maximum likelihood algorithm to obtain the coordinates of unknown nodes. The simulation shows that the unknown node has achieved better positioning results in the IoT positioning model based on wireless sensor network topology and has higher positioning accuracy.}

But realizing this opportunity requires to move beyond traditional boundaries, separate the hype from reality, and strengthen the focus on the social shaping of smart cities. The investigation demonstrates that, in order for such a social shaping to develop, the design of smart cities needs to be understood as a collective action in which two complementary forces are combined. On the one hand, the faith in the technological advancement exposed in the utopian thinking. On the other, the knowledge, skills, and interests of a quadruple-helix collaborative environment where the need for technological innovation in response to urban sustainability goals is not shaped by the corporate sector and its technocentric and market-oriented logic, but an open community whose actions serve the public interest and are based on a holistic interpretation of smart city development.}

We introduce a “science goal” as a mechanism for users to define scientific objectives and conditions of interest. To provide an abstraction to run applications on an ensemble of edge computing nodes, we implement a two-layered scheduler—cloud and edge scheduler. In this scheduling model, the users submit their goals to the cloud scheduler. These goals are conveyed to the appropriate nodes based on a variety of constraints including geographical area, resource availability, node capabilities, and applicability. The edge scheduler, with complete understanding of the current conditions, assumes the responsibility for executing the applications on the nodes so that the users' science goals are met. This paper provides a framework for the two-layered scheduling model for goal-driven edge computing and motivates and informs its architecture through a case study.}

The multitude of stakeholders involved in governing Bangkok's food system is not just inter-related, but also linked and connected from top-to-bottom. These stakeholders include central and local governments, large food corporations, civil society organizations and even the daily life practices of street food venders and mobile markets. As a result, the article suggests, the governance of the city food agenda in Bangkok is both empowered and participatory, because organizations from the top and the middle are unable to sustain the development of food systems without including ordinary people in the actions taken to create them. This suggests legal frameworks, plans and related infrastructure development, are insufficient for Bangkok be smart in sustaining the development of cities food systems. As while the public sector facilitates food production and distribution through the regionalization process (including the conservation of the peri-urban agriculture, irrigation systems development, and central fresh food markets establishment), the smart city food agenda still requires operations from below to sustain such technical innovations.}

abstract = {Smartness is a vague concept with different meanings for different people. It is imperative to harness the latent potential of existing settlements for an inclusive smart urban development. The study aims to assess the socio-cultural attributes of an Indian historic urban landscape with a thriving residential culture. Since data collection of neighborhood-level urban communities is not feasible in India, a structured questionnaire was used to conduct household surveys. Such real-world phenomena have inherent imprecision and ambiguity associated with human judgments. Therefore, the survey items are assumed as fuzzy linguistic variables, and the raw dataset is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy arithmetic and weighted averaging operators are applied for the hierarchical evaluation of indicators and variables. A robust algorithm is used for the dimension reduction of a fuzzy coded dataset while dealing with subjective responses. The aggregated fuzzy scores show an overall better performance of traditional communities with respect to their socio-cultural attributes, such as a sense of safety and collective efficacy. The application of fuzzy logic in urban planning and allied behavioral studies can effectively and pragmatically deal with the inherent uncertainties in a humanistic system. Future researchers may explore fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation approaches for ordinal scale datasets.}

In this method, the monthly and quarterly brightness temperature background field was first established, and then the offshore seismic TIR anomaly were got by wavelet transform and relative power spectrum method from MODIS data. Finally, the current seismic TIR anomaly in the adjacent sea is analyzed and discussed in terms of space–time changes, sequential variation of power spectrum, relationship between anomaly area and earthquake magnitude, sensor performance and the assimilation of brightness temperature background field.

abstract = {The smart city seeks a highly interconnected, monitored and globally optimized environment to profit from the synergies among systems such as energy, transports or waste management. From an energy perspective, transport systems and facilities are among the bigger energy consumers inside cities. However, despite the research available on such systems, few works focus on their interactions and potential synergies to increase their efficiencies. This paper address this problem by assessing the benefits of the interconnection and joint management of different energy systems in a smart city context. This is done using a linear programming problem, modelling a district with residential loads, distributed energy resources (DER) and electric vehicles (EV), which are also connected to an electrical metro substation. This connection allows to store the metro regenerative braking energy into EVs' batteries to be used later for other trains or for the EVs themselves. The objective of the linear programming model is to find the optimal planning and operation of all the considered systems, achieving minimum energy costs. Therefore, the main contributions of this paper are the assessment of synergies of the interconnection of these systems and the detailed analysis of the impact of different EV penetration levels. Results show important economic benefits for the overall system (up to 30%) when the investments and its operation are globally optimized, especially reducing the metro energy costs. Also, analysing the energy transfers between metro-EV, it is evident that the metro takes advantages of the cheaper energy coming from the district (through the EVs), showing the existence of “opportunistic” synergies. Lastly, EV saturation points (where extra EVs represent more load but do not provide additional useful storage to the system) can be relatively small (200–300 EVs) when the energy transfer to the metro electrical substation is restricted, but it is also reduced by the presence of DER systems.}

abstract = {Given a scale expansion of Internet of Things for sustainable resource management in smart cities, proper design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical to safeguard the future network infrastructure from intruders. With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance.}

In this paper, we take the technology a step towards real-world implementation by proposing a set of adaptive and privacy-preserving mechanisms that can be incorporated into existing encounter-based routing protocols to reduce summary vector sizes without compromising delivery guarantees. We validate our proposals with real-world human movement traces and simulation experiments. In terms of network performance, our proposals reduce the average summary vector size by 75% to achieve up to 21% less energy consumption with about 28% improvement in throughput.}

Big data is typically characterized by five distinct features namely, volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. To gain insights and to monetize big data, data has to be collected, stored, processed, analyzed, mined, and visualized. This paper identifies the primary layers of a big data architecture with start-of-the-art communication, storage, and processing technologies that can be utilized to gain meaningful insights and intelligence from big data. In addition, this paper gives an in-depth overview for research and development who intend to explore the various techniques and technologies that can be implemented for harnessing big data value utilizing the recent big data specific processing and visualization tools. Finally, a use case model utilizing the above mentioned technologies for Smart Grid is presented to demonstrate the energy big data road map from generation to monetization. Our key findings highlight the significance of selecting the appropriate big data tools and technologies for each layer of big data architecture, detailing their advantages and disadvantages. We pinpoint the critical shortcomings of existing works, particularly the lack of a unified framework that effectively integrates these layers for smart city applications. This gap presents both a challenge and an opportunity for future research, suggesting a need for more holistic and interoperable solutions in big data management and utilization.}

Climate change and social inequality are the present-day calamities and part of the sustainable development goals to be addressed while redefining the 21st century city as an agent of resilient change. The essential links between environmental systems, sustainability, public space, social justice, and information and communications technology (ICT) need to be reinforced through urban design and planning of our cities. In this chapter, innovative solutions from across the globe reflecting efficiency and flexibility in urban services have been discussed as examples of ICT-information and communications technology related initiatives for improving the quality of life index of our cities. Across multiple dimensions, the scale and speed of urbanization is unprecedented, and especially so in developing regions. Today, in Asia, the urban agglomerations and anticipated growth in urban population will require one of the most massive build-up of urban infrastructure. Since there is much to learn from countries with the fastest rate of urbanization, paradigms and cases from India have been cited for impacting urban policies in cities all over the world. As agglomerations of population and services increase, cities need to acknowledge their potential vulnerability to the impacts of mass migration and natural hazards, mainly due to our growing energy and resource consumption. One of the recommendations for successfully implementing innovative concepts is that based on diverse perspectives and multidisciplinary dialog the “smart cities” initiative must support programmatic interventions as well as facilitate community partnerships and citizen participation. The focus of smart cities needs to remain on the sustainable and equitable use of a city’s resources—natural, human, and financial. The conclusion is that our cities are a joint built and natural environment, which requires a design-driven, integrative, and systems-based approach, one grounded in a deep understanding of social life, political context, ecological transformation, and spatial thinking.}

It merges the dimensions of sustainable development (environmentally responsible and equitable economic development) and city hospitality (the extent to which the city acts as a good ‘host’ to all its ‘guests’, including residents and businesses). Resilience resides at its centre to highlight the temporal aspects of these dimensions, and their interdependencies.

The targeted framework is based on Bakry's STOPE (Strategy; Technology; Organization; People; and Environment) view: the five-domain structured, comprehensive, and flexible view that has been previously used for various technology and society problems. The framework provides a common base for the description of the current and targeted states of cities and for the development of plans toward transforming them from their current states to their targeted ones. It is used for highlighting Riyadh smart city strategy and illustrating its current development. Based on the outcomes, the chapter discusses potential future work that supports future development. It is hoped that the chapter would provide an example to follow by other Gulf Cooperation Council cities and may be by other cities around the world.}

abstract = {Designing a zero emission neighborhood (ZEN) from an energy point of view, has the benefit of distributing loads over time by creating a mosaic of buildings which individually may not have a zero emission balance, but reach it as an ensemble. Responsive building envelopes (RBEs) are expected to play an important role in the design of ZENs and future smart sustainable cities. RBEs are useful to optimize the balance between several energy flows at single- and multi building scale, as well as to actively manage both on-site renewable- and purchased energy in addition to improving user experience and indoor comfort by providing an interactive interface with the outdoors. This article provides a review of the potential and the requirements associated with using RBEs to manage complex interactions between buildings, clusters of buildings and utility grids. A six-step pathway for the implementation of RBEs in ZEN-like projects are proposed. The six steps are related to identifying; purpose of response, scale and interdependency, functionality, trigger and control, interactions and finally to identifying technical solutions. The proposed process emphasizes the importance of defining specific information such as the responsive goal hierarchies, the scale of the responses in relation to their purpose, and the importance of the aesthetic expression to foster positive user experience.}

However, the critical and significant problem still not studied in depth that is how to select an effective ML algorithm when there are numbers of ML algorithms for cyber attacks detection system for IoT security. In this paper, we proposed a new framework model and a hybrid algorithm to solve this problem. Firstly BoT-IoT identification dataset is applied and its 44 effective features are selected from a number of features for the machine learning algorithm. Then five effective machine learning algorithm is selected for the identification of malicious and anomaly traffic identification and also select the most widely ML algorithm performance evaluation metrics. To find out which ML algorithm is effective and should be used to select for IoT anomaly and intrusion traffic identification, a bijective soft set approach and its algorithm is applied. Then we applied the proposed algorithm based on bijective soft set approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed model with the algorithm is effective for the selection ML algorithm out of numbers of ML algorithms.}

The more precise evaluation allows to assess the correct interventions for energy requalification under a smart cities perspective. This study was performed considering a stationary software (Aermec MC11300) and a dynamic software (TRNSYS). Three simulations considering transparent elements characterized by progressively improved properties of thermal transmittance and solar gain factor have been performed. It has been performed a comparison between the outputs of the two software in order to highlight the different ways of evaluating the energy contributions on thermal loads. Finally, the models were validated by means of an in-situ measurement campaign using a heat flow meter - in order to measure the thermal transmittance of the opaque walls - and a thermographic camera. This modus operandi allowed to appreciate how the use of a dynamic software is more appropriate to deal with the inertial properties of the structure to calculate in a more detailed way the annual thermal loads and to obtain more information on individual heating zones.}

A methodological framework for multiple steps ahead parking availability prediction is presented. Two different types of predictions are provided: the probability of a free space to continue being free in subsequent time intervals, and the short-term parking occupancy prediction in selected regions of an urban road network. The available data come from a wide network of on-street parking sensors in the “smart” city of Santander, Spain. The sensor network is segmented in four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals. Moreover, simple genetically optimized multilayer perceptrons accurately predict region parking occupancy rates up to 30 minutes in the future by exploiting 1-minute data. Finally, the real time, Web-based, implementation of the proposed parking prediction availability system is presented.}

In order to meet these applications' requirements, Ultra-Dense Network (UDN) is considered as one of the promising technological enablers in 5G. 5G UDN deployments are envisaged to be heterogeneous and dense, mainly through the provisioning of small cells such as picocells and femtocells, from different Radio Access Technologies (RATs). Nevertheless, various studies have reported that the densification is not always beneficial to the network performance. As the network density increases, this will pose further requirements and complexity of determining which RAT a user should connect with at a given time. Hence, an efficient RAT selection mechanism to choose the best Radio Access Technology among multiple available ones is a must. This paper proposes a new Context-aware Radio Access Technology (CRAT) selection mechanism that examines the context of the user and the networks in choosing the appropriate RAT to serve. A simplified conceptual model of the Context-aware RAT selection is introduced. Then, a mathematical model of CRAT considering the user and network context is derived, adopting Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) for weighting the importance of the selection criteria and TOPSIS for ranking the available RATs. The proposed CRAT was implemented and validated in NS3 simulation environment. The performance of the proposed mechanism was tested using two different scenarios within a smart city environment, called a shopping mall and urban city scenarios. The obtained results showed that CRAT outperforms the conventional approach namely A2A4 of RAT selection in terms of the number of handovers, average network delay, throughput, and packet delivery ratio.}

This study has been applied to 41 European cities from 18 countries and two complementary clustering methods were used in order to determine the clusters. In addition, for a better interpretation of the results and a more accurate classification of the cities, a detailed analysis was performed in each domain to conclude with a global analysis which groups all the indicators and domains. The paper describes the overall approach of the REMOURBAN Sustainable Urban Regeneration Model, to focus then on the methodology applied to characterise the European cities as basis for the replication of this model.

abstract = {Gigantic progressions in heterogeneous communication technologies have empowered smart cities (SCs) to communicate with each other, while ensuring network connectivity. These innovations cannot give impeccable network availability in SCs, because of the coexistence of thousands of gadgets, which realize some issues. In this paper, to resolve the issue of ubiquitous communication provisioning, the MADM techniques are employed for network selection in proposed scenarios under phase 1. Data rate, transmission power, latency, cost, reliability, coverage range, channel bandwidth and security attributes of diverse available networks are utilized for optimal network selection. Cohesive AHP-Entropy weights of respective attributes are derived from subjective weights generated by AHP and objective weights calculated by Entropy. Cohesive weights are employed by TOPSIS algorithm for ranking of the networks available in the vicinity of level 1, 2 and 3 of the communication networks hierarchy. The network with the highest preference level has been selected for communication. The implementation of proposed criterion showed that 3G (HSDPA), WLAN (802.11p), Bluetooth (802.15.1), WiMAX (802.16), Wi-Fi haLow (802.11 ah), 4G have the highest preference level in proposed scenarios UPN, HN, HAN, CR, NAN/MAN and WAN environments respectively. The continuous monitoring of the connected networks and time-to-time selection of optimal networks is required for provisioning of ubiquitous communication in diverse applications (e.g. smart buildings and infrastructure services, smart traffic and transportation system, smart metering of electricity, water, gas and emergency calling services) of SCs. In phase 2, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition and provisioning of ubiquitous communication network in SCs. According to the suitability of applications, the data is acquired by proposed diverse acquisition techniques. Computing at diverse levels 1, 2 and 3 is described in phase 3 for provisioning of offloading, reducing delay and complexity. The overall framework resulted in real-time system scenario for smart cities in forthcoming days.}

To understand the difficulties of integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in electricity distribution network, the analyses and result of the effects on aspects of power quality are provided, as can be the problem of failure defects in networks and how DG grid connection affects voltage control at both medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) levels. Results demonstrated that there was a communication system between all generators protective systems, a selective protective system, a tracking of perturbations system to isolate failure defects, and a phase control system between the generators and the network. Also synchronizing voltage regulation is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the power supply. Currently, recent and modern technologies allow different services to share a single communications infrastructure while guaranteeing the required levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. This paper aims to provide a Smart City (SC) project, implemented in the city of Malaga, Spain, where the integration of the applications of Smart Grid (SG) and the Use Cases (UCs) for the different functionalities of SG has been developed. The SC architecture proposed envisions a hierarchical, distributed, and autonomous structure to address the challenge of smart distribution grids. As a result of this project, new levels of standardization of languages and protocols and new interconnection functions will be required. These functions will allow smart devices to recognize each other so that they can reconnect in case of failure regardless of the state of the network topology. In conclusion, renewable energy sources (RES) can be optimally integrated into the distribution grid. Generation can approach consumption through the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and mini-wind generators, with the reuse of electrical infrastructure.}

abstract = {Now-a-days, with the ever increasing number of vehicles, getting parking space at right place and on time has become an inevitable necessity for all across the globe. In this context, finding an unoccupied parking slot by the interested vehicle owners with least overhead becomes an NP-Hard problem bounded by various constraints. In-advance availability of information regarding parking occupancy plays a major role in hassle free trip optimization for motorists. It also facilitates services-cum-profit management for the parking owners. It further helps in curbing congestion by reducing cruising time and hence, helps in controlling pollution of the smart cities. Thus, accurate and timely information regarding parking occupancy and availability has become the basic need in the evolution of the smart cities. Motivated by these facts, an occupancy-driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme uses machine learning based approaches to predict occupancy of parking lots, which in turn is used to deduce occupancy driven prices for arriving vehicles. In order to train, test, and compare different machine learning models, on-street parking data of Seattle city has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that parking occupancy prediction system is used to generate occupancy based parking prices for on-street parking system of the Seattle city. Results obtained using the proposed occupancy driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing state-of-the-art schemes.}

As it is still in its early stages, this case of “Alger Smart City” is illustrated through a qualitative study conducted among information and communication technologies experts and involved actors. The preliminary findings are as follows: (1) the predominance of technology over citizens’ uses in designing smart city; (2) the emphasis on solving daily problems (e.g., traffic jam); (3) the limited role given to citizens as potential beneficiaries—instead of partners—in smart city design; and (4) an underestimation of digital divide risks and social dislocation engendered by technology dissemination in an emerging country.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network serves as the core source of data in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The WSN nodes sense, aggregate, and relay sensed data for the different services in the IoT. The reliability of the aggregated and transmitted information is crucial for the effectiveness of IoT services. The data from multiple sensors at different timestamps need to be fused for efficient data transmission, reducing complexity and improving the reliability of the data being transmitted, improving the quality of IoT services. Therefore, data fusion is an essential aspect of WSN, where multiple sensors collect and combine data to produce a single, more comprehensive data for transmission. This data fusion reduces the amount of data transmission and network energy consumption and increases the accuracy of the result. This paper introduces a Categorised Information Fusion Model (CIFM) to minimise the replication in handling the aggregation of multiple instances of sensor data by categorising the information. The proposed CIFM employs federated learning for distributed verification of different aggregation time frames. This learning identifies the replication of sensor data from different sensors based on time frames and aggregation instances. In the multi-timed aggregation level, the sensed information's interfering distribution is diminished by controlling the relaying instance. The recurrent learning instances diminish the multi-timed information based on the occurrence factor. This recurrent learning improves delivery precision by controlling computation complexity and fusion time. The CIFM model also reduces the communication overhead by reducing the amount of replicated information that needs to be transmitted and processed and providing a consistent delivery ratio. The use of federated learning also allows for privacy-preserving data processing as the raw data is only processed locally, and aggregated results are shared. The performance of the proposed CIFM model is evaluated through simulations and compared with other existing fusion methods. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing accuracy and communication efficiency methods. This approach helps to simplify the process of aggregating and relaying the data in the WSN to improve the performance and efficiency of IoT services. The goal of CIFM is to provide a more effective way to process and utilise the information from the sensors to deliver accurate and reliable data to the IoT platform. The CIFM improves the fusion rate by 7.77 % and minimize the fusion time up to 13.03 % compared to other methods.}

abstract = {This paper presents lessons learnt through empirical research work developed in three metropolitan cities in South Italy aimed at exploring if and how the “Smart” framework might improve urban planning in cities with lacks in planning processes. Authors argue that organized networks of citizens (such as non-profit organizations or private associations) together with networks of institutions (such as partnerships amongst municipalities or universities) are needed in order to improve the smartness of a city; technologies are framed as opportunities and supports for more inclusive and informed decision-making processes, i.e. as a tool, rather than as a goal, for effective smartness. The paper discusses the primary findings of a Research Project conducted at the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering (DICEA), University of Naples, titled “Smart Energy Master for the Energy Management of Territory” funded by EU. The methodology is based on the case-study method, whose sources of evidence are: quantitative indicators, archival documents, and excerpts from interviews with key stakeholders. In detail, the paper focuses on three Southern Italian cities (Reggio Calabria, Catania and Palermo), which have been clustered for similar challenges they have to face, in relation to their geographical proximity and cultural features. Findings show the twofold use of technologies for cities: on the one hand, technology may be perceived as a panacea and Smart initiatives may be isolated and episodic experiments; on the other, technologies may be critically incorporated in complex policies and initiatives aimed at regenerating urban areas holistically, and Smart initiatives may be coordinated and well-connected experiences. Authors argue that the second cases are feasible approaches for improving urban planning in challenging South-European contexts.}

The first path introduces a holistic perspective of smart city development, which emerges from the peer-reviewed publications produced by European universities. The second path, in contrast, stands on the grey literature produced by the American corporate sector, which endorses a techno-centric understanding of the smart city subject.

With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.}

In order to deal with these phenomena, it is essential to have an in-depth understanding of the processes that lead to the occurrence of congestion and its spilling over into contiguous areas of the city. The professional literature has a long history of studying the propagation of congestion, but so far the authors have focused on discovering frequent patterns and determining propagation probabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the Congestion Propagation Modeling Algorithm (CPMA) presented in this article is the first to be able to determine the expected value of propagation times for any propagation pattern as well as propagation probabilities using Markov chains. Our method was subjected to a detailed performance analysis using a dataset extracted from real road networks, during which we examined how accurately our model determines the propagation times of congestion, which is especially important for municipal traffic management organizations if they want to prevent the propagation of a local congestion and proliferation in the city. According to our measurements, our method can determine the probability of congestion occurring several times a day and the length of congestion propagation times with an accuracy that allows effective intervention by traffic management authorities.}

Nowadays the production, transport and logistics of food requires high costs and transport and harvest from other parts of the planet to the cities, associated to intensive polluting technologies. Aquaponics can play a key role enabling local production, fresh, free of pesticides and healthy with short supply chains in the cities. Despite the technical developments in aquaponics there is still no integrated approach to analyze their potential as urban agriculture. This paper aims to contextualize the aquaponics as urban farming and analyze the necessary developments in that field, namely, the need of an integrated approach from producers to consumers on smart cities.

abstract = {Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect’s face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer’s uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.}

Two smart city cases are investigated showing that dashboards can improve transparency and accountability, however, realizing these benefits was cumbersome and encountered various risks and challenges. Challenges include insufficient data quality, lack of understanding of data, poor analysis, wrong interpretation, confusion about the outcomes, and imposing a pre-defined view. These challenges can easily result in misconceptions, wrong decision-making, creating a blurred picture resulting in less transparency and accountability, and ultimately in even less trust in the government. Principles guiding the design of dashboards are presented. Dashboards need to be complemented by mechanisms supporting citizens' engagement, data interpretation, governance and institutional arrangements.}
