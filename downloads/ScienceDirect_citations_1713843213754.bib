The first part of this chapter introduces the concepts and practices of green bonds. It emphasizes the importance to design green bonds to maintain financial and environmental relevance under different instruments and practices. The second part of this chapter focuses upon the use of certification schemes in the formulations and implementations of green bonds. It indicates that the certification schemes can be effective instrument to secure the accountability of environmental performance of target investments through green bonds and hence promote the development of green bonds. It also stresses the importance of monitoring and reporting the environmental impacts of green bond projects in the post-issuance period so that investors are assured that their target investments maintain their environmental performance in the project implementation phase. The end of this chapter addresses some examples of the use of green bonds for smart cities both in developed and developing countries.}

abstract = {In the smart cities, the travel-time is a typical business calculation to monitor and control the traffic congestions. But it still faces challenges on real-time stream due to the limitation of latency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for travel-time calculation on stream of recognized data of vehicles. Compared with other types of sensory data in urban roads, the recognized data of vehicles has wider coverage, finer interval and more exact locality. Our approach continuously achieves both factual and predictive values, and consists of two-step spatio-temporal parallelism on real-time data and Bayes prior rules mining on historical data. It can be analyzed theoretically for its low latency with high accuracy, and has been implemented on Apache Storm correlated with Hadoop MapReduce. Through exhaustive experiments on simulated and real data, our approach holds millisecond-level latencies steadily on high speed stream with nearly linear scalability, and keeps the accuracy above 80% for prediction.}

abstract = {The concept of accessibility – the ease with which people can reach places or opportunities –lies at the heart of what makes cities livable, workable and sustainable. As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.}

Often the congestion has a considerable influence on the travel time, travel distance, fuel consumption and air pollution. This paper proposes a novel dynamic centralized simulated annealing based approach for finding optimal vehicle routes using a VIKOR type of cost function. Five attributes: the average travel speed of the traffic, vehicles density, roads width, road traffic signals and the roads' length are utilized by the proposed approach to find the optimal paths. The average travel speed and vehicles density values can be obtained from the sensors deployed in smart cities and communicated to vehicles and roadside communication units via vehicular ad hoc networks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with four other algorithms, over two test scenarios: Birmingham and Turin city centres. These show the proposed method improves traffic efficiency in the presence of congestion by an overall average of 24.05%, 48.88% and 36.89% in terms of travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission, respectively, for a test scenario from Birmingham city in the UK. Additionally, similar performance patterns are achieved for the a test with data from Turin, Italy.}

This digital transformation through agile drivers will help address the increasing challenges of urbanization in a couple of decades. The cyberphysical system (CPS) is becoming pervasive in every aspect of smart city daily life and can be considered as one of the four fundamental conceptual approaches of the fourth generation industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). CPS is used to describe the next generation of a diverse spectrum of complicated, multidisciplinary, physically comprehending engineered systems that integrate embedded cyber aspects into the physical world. It implants computation technologies, communication control, the convergence of information, and physical processes together with strategic importance internationally. CPS is still a vast research area. As a result, it opens venues for applications across multiple scales. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the related works, focusing on the design to understand CPS more precisely, and how it relates to different research fields, current concepts, and real-life applications. Further, it enumerates an extensive set of CPS challenges and opportunities, introducing visionary ideas, research strategies, and future trends expected by 2030 for critical future-oriented technological solutions, like cloud computing, Internet of Things, and big data. These technological solutions are to play a critical role in CPS research and have significant impacts on the smart city.}

Moreover, multilingual speech recognition systems, speech-to-speech translation, interactive voice assistive systems, and other speech systems may offer better sophistication to smart cities. Many multilingual speech systems use language identification (LID) systems as an ancillary technology. In development of efficient smart cities, the speech systems need to be robust to noise and mobile environments. This work aims toward developing an LID system that can robustly operate in clean and noisy conditions. The three major approaches explored in developing LID systems to improve the performance in varying background conditions are front-end speech enhancement methods, a front-end vowel region-based robust feature extraction method, and a curriculum learning method. In this work, deep neural networks and deep neural networks with attention architectures are explored to develop LID systems using an AP17-OLR database. The performance of LID systems is studied at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels using white and vehicular noises from a NOISEX dataset. The performance of LID systems is reported in terms of the equal error rate. It is observed from the experiments that multi-SNR-based curriculum learning models can generalize the LID performance in noisy environments.}

More and more people are eager to exchange all kinds of information in urban life through an efficient network. Therefore, designing a smart data distribution and transmission mechanism can not only improve people's quality of life but also pave the way for reducing environmental pollution. Optical networks have been widely used in the core network due to high-capacity characteristics. However, in inter-data-center (Inter-DC) optical networks, the coexisted heterogeneous optical devices and multi-granularity network resources bring new challenges to network management and traffic scheduling. Recently, software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have been introduced to enable the unified control for improving network agility and automation. Thus for software-defined multi-granularity Inter-DC optical networks, we propose a list of online service provisioning strategies. Moreover, in terms of the network controller, the novel routing applications are also developed by extended OpenFlow protocol. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the overall feasibility of proposed solutions in a semi-practical platform. Numerical simulations conducted to quantitatively evaluate the algorithm efficiency also verify the superiorities of improving spectrum efficiency and reducing service blocking probability.}

Their introduction, however, is challenged by a complex multi-stakeholder configuration, and by ‘rules of the game’ (institutional conditions) which are essential for the cooperation between stakeholders but perceived to be outdated. To address this issue, the central research question in this article is: ‘which institutional conditions enable or disable decision-making processes regarding the introduction of smart energy systems in selected city district development projects?’ We conducted in-depth interviews and collected secondary data for four case studies in the Netherlands. Data were analysed, and cases were compared using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, and the method of causal process tracing. The results reveal that only stakeholders in the position of project leader were actively pursuing the projects’ goals (position rules), legal barriers as well as path dependency of previous decisions limited the available choices (choice rules), and agreement was lacking on sharing costs and benefits (aggregation rules). As ‘rules of the game’ for decision-making continue to present a challenge for the introduction of smart energy systems, future research and policy-making should pay attention to the creation and adequate orchestration of such rules.}

In order to materialize this concept, a new generation of adaptable systems of intelligent supervisory predictive control (ISPC) is introduced and implemented in which energy consumption tends to be minimized without sacrificing occupants thermal comfort. The methodology of ISPC includes building thermal simulation and multi-objective optimization algorithm that interact with conventional machine-level controllers of HVAC systems, to define optimized setpoints considering current and forecasted operation conditions. The development of a reliable surrogate model, based on robust machine learning techniques, is a key feature to confer greenness to a building in order to promote sustainability in the built environment and finally to have a smart green building. It is showed that the proposed ISPC is capable of delivering a robust, energy- and cost-effective decision while being independent of the HVAC system. The implemented energy management, as a non-destructive retrofitting procedure, can be applied to both new and existing buildings and with any level of HVAC technology.}

abstract = {It is evident that the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is already knocking on our door [43]. Cities are growing by the day, and current integrated information and communication technologies (ICT) are invited to adapt to the new reality. The proliferation of connected nodes, combined with the urgency of new designs of products in order to accommodate this new era, are raising major security issues that the ICT community has been asked to examine. Is the existing technology able to achieve a secure environment within the vastly developing smart cities? There are many factors that ought to be taken into consideration, apart from solely securing the smart cities. Specifically, the newly developed technologies need to be able to reduce consumed resources, as well as increase the quality of life of the citizens, without jeopardizing their privacy. The use of blockchain-based systems attempts to address these emerging issues. In particular, the blockchain model presents an opportunity to end the current practice of storing information on third-party ledgers, which requires vast data security resources to secure their perimeter [6]. This chapter aims, primarily, to address the security issues that unfold during the transition from the conventional way of living to the interconnected world of smart cities. Moreover, we will take a thorough look at the blockchain model, and explore why this may be considered the answer to the security and privacy issues that arise from the new era. In particular, we will explore the interaction of blockchain with smart contracts and their application in e-governance. This seems to be gaining ground towards the more general concept of e-democracy. Well-known models of e-residency [36] will be used as a point of reference in order to make a more thorough investigation of its introduction and implementation in the world of smart contracts. This study will make suggestions for improvement and additions of new scripts that might be able to assist the further improvement of this challenging and overly ambitious venture.}

Data vitalization related to in-city data collection and their appropriate diffusion to city actors (private and professional) and their services (applications) is the main issue. In the context of Hotspot-based Internet, Location-based services and Internet of Things, we study User-oriented systems with four typical variants related to transportation and user' behavior: a dynamic lane allocation system, a system for urban goods delivery, bus shelter-based communication, and street and store consumer adapted guidance and advertising.}

Current research in this area is limited to the dissemination of emergency information to vehicles after an accident. However, such emergency situations necessitate prompt dissemination of information to the relevant parties prior to the collision save lives. This paper proposes an intelligent collision avoidance routing technique for VANETs (CARVNET) to address this formidable obstacle. The proposed intelligent communication system aims to avoid collisions on roads by disseminating emergency warning messages instantly to the concerned entities as soon as it detects a driver’s abnormal health condition. Simulation studies are conducted in NETSIM to validate the proposed technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing communication systems by improving throughput by up to 50%, packet transmission by 20%, packet delivery ratio by 10%, and delay to a negligible degree.}

abstract = {Today electric car and Smart Grid are potential elements of any ‘Smart City’ initiative. According to several recent studies, French citizens are ready to purchase an electric car. Despite of these positive figures, sales of the electric cars are not really taking-off, but slightly increasing. Although, previous studies have identified motivation and barriers for the diffusion of electric cars (EC), we hypothesise, that the analysis of the a priori knowledge of the actors, in particular the users, can be enriched and it will provide a new understanding of the spread of EC. However, there is no studies explaining the types of representations people have of the EC, particularly for non-users, in order to have a better consideration of individuals, not so much as consumers or users, but rather as citizens. Thus, this paper explores the determining factors that determine how social groups perceive the emerging technology of EC and thus provide elements about a potential acceptability enabling its dissemination. In order to achieve this, this paper proposes a new approach based on the use of the AttrakDiff-2 questionnaire, a specific User eXperience (UX) method. This method assesses four different but complementary aspects of the social representation: the possibility of action of the subject on the system; the stimulation, caused, by the system; how the user will identify with the system and, the overall attraction. Data about the social representations of electric car for 131 potential users in the Lorraine Region of France were collected and analysed. Results show that there are differences of user representation regarding the socio-demographic variables. The proposed approach will provide relevant inputs to the infrastructure network design and Smart City policy decision makers.}

In detail, the former perspective, and the most widespread one so far, has led mainly to a focus on mitigation issues, contributing to the achievement of the limited (although desirable) goal to optimize existing infrastructures and services to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency. Nevertheless, based on the human-centered perspective, the smart city concept could encompass more than merely mitigation, allowing the establishment of collaborative and continuously learning decision-making processes, crucial to enhance the transition toward climate-sensitive urban development.}

Due to the presence of low-power devices as information collectors and actuators in the IoT, physical layer security is a promising solution for privacy-aware Smart Cities because of its low implementation cost, and relatively low complexity compared with computation-intensive cryptographic techniques. In this chapter, we first introduce the physical layer architectures suitable for the IoT and discuss the technological challenges associated with them. Building upon them, we present novel optimization techniques and smart green cooperative protocols for maximizing security. We conclude the chapter by discussing open research directions that need further investigation for realizing energy-efficient secure Smart Cities.}

In this paper, we achieve two main objectives to comply with fifth-generation networks goals and serving the SM applications. First one is to enhance the Narrowband-Internet-of-Things spectral efficiency. The second is to alleviate the signalling burden during each transmission request for SMs. First, we model the uplink scheduler for the NB-IoT access network using the state-machine modelling methodology on the Simulink environment. The simulation results are verified and validated with trusted modelling technique. Second, we optimize the NB-IoT uplink scheduler, which exploits the periodicity nature of SMs applications. We achieve that by proposing an integrated scheduling protocol which rearranges the transmission times of different smart meters utilities, and it draws a map for the transmission schedule of them to better utilize the sparse time resources. The proposed approach comprises architecture, signalling, and algorithms. We evaluate the optimization in term of numbers of SMs versus four performance indicators; resources utilization, spectral efficiency, setup success percentage, and session drop rate according to a case study. The simulation results prove the ability of our proposal to increase the spectrum utilization to 17.47%. This enhancement reflects on spectral efficiency that improved doubled.}

However, the smart city issue cannot be tackled within a single policy area in the European Union (EU), as it requires a large combination of approaches, from technology to energy and transport, and cohesion and regional development policies. The capacity to propose policies on sustainable cities requires from politicians a systemic approach to sustainability and indeed the ability to put forward ambitious plans for change. It is an assumption of this text that the EU can play a major role in shaping the changes. It is also claimed that party politics at the European level face a major opportunity to foster democratic processes by adopting these topics. These are policy issues that touch the citizen’s everyday life, and thus carry the potential to bring the citizens and parties closer together. With reference to European political parties discourse, especially at the time of the 2019 European Parliament elections, the chapter covers their main perspectives on environment, sustainability, and urban life.}

Packet generation for each machine is modeled by means of three mathematical distributions (Poisson, Beta, and Deterministic), which makes it possible to represent a wide variety of M2M applications. A case study was constructed based on the city of Montreal. Real data on the position of machines were retrieved from public datasets. The case study includes a realistic representation of the LTE infrastructure that allows the estimation of traffic load at each eNodeB, as well as other performance indexes, such as collision probability and access delay.

This paper argues that emergent aspects of food policy in the UK can be understood as a social movement, which sustains development by way of bottom-up, horizontal networks of urban groups, and business associations. It suggests that as platforms of food provision, such on-line food networks offer a counter-point to top-down smart city development predicated on high-tech infrastructure. Such complex arrangements demonstrate how the city needs to be understood as a networked field of action, not simply an administratively bounded construction. Within the field of action movements emerge, whose activism is successful in influencing policymaking, and in shaping the municipal strategies assembled to build the regional structure of food provision. The caveat this paper highlights is that, although successful in influencing policy and municipal strategies, the activism of these movements has not been as effective as might have been anticipated from such a democratic impulse. This lack reflects the limited power of cities in the UK over the structure of food provision, but also the troubled extension of public participation into a territory marked by corporate and agricultural policy. The paper bases its claims about the nature of urban food policies in cities on a case study of networks in Bristol, including interviews with key activists, analysis social media networks and documents. The evidence supports claims that urban food developments represent a form of social movement, whose activism is democratic in its attempts to be both sustainable and inclusive.}

This study presents an RSRU TM method for better traffic management in order to provide a secure manner of delivery.

The on-board vehicle unit, server-side unit, and client-side unit all receive signals from the nearest cloudlet using our RSRU-TM mechanism. After that, give the data transmission activity via VA. As a result, the Vehicular Authority (VA) develops an adequate transportation plan in order to create a traffic management scenario. To accomplish successful IoVN, compute congestion avoidance, data transmission, distance coverage scenario, and traffic management parameters (Internet based Vehicular Network).

In this context, the number of traffic collisions, especially in intersections, has rapidly increased as well as the number of vehicles. The leading cause of this is represented by human errors in recognition and decision making. Thus, the development of secure Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems is an emerging challenge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent AIM (MA-AIM) system based on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) communications able to safely manage vehicles crossing through an intersection leveraging both Edge of Things (EoT) and Blockchain facilities. The proposed system includes an Intersection Manager Agent (IMA) that: i) interacts with vehicles through Driver Agents (DAs) installed on them in an EoT environment, and ii) uses Blockchain mechanisms in order to orchestrate the passage of vehicles crossing the intersection safely. In particular, we implemented a proof-of-concept integrating the AIM 4.0 simulator with Hyperledger Fabric (implementing Blockchain capabilities) and with Node-RED (implementing V2I/I2V communications in an EoT environment). Preliminary experiments show the feasibility and potentiality of our solution.}

abstract = {The decarbonization of cities’ energy systems requires multiple data sources, increasingly available at different temporal and spatial resolutions, as well as integrated energy planning tools to identify smart and sustainable solutions. This chapter presents the case of Évora Municipality, in Portugal, which launched several initiatives toward a smart city, namely, the rollout of more than 34,000 smart meters from 2010. An integrated analytical framework, supported by multiple data sources, models and tools over the city, is presented to illustrate how decarbonized pathways up to 2030 can be generated throughout an energy planning process. A codesign practice with the stakeholders’ participation along this process was taken as a crucial step to consider aspects other than technological options and its cost-effectiveness. Évora city’s energy system includes residential buildings, transport and mobility, other energy demand sectors (i.e., waste water and sewage systems, industries, public lighting, public buildings, services, and agriculture), and the energy supply system, including local renewable energy sources. Multiple cost-effective measures were assessed through a multicriteria tool, and its costs were estimated to feed a mid-term sustainable energy plan. Évora is presented as an example of a smart city regarding its energy system, with implemented and planned smart solutions to be adopted for a sustainable and local empowered city.}

Sustainable urban development emerges as an essential planning goal in many jurisdictions seeking to cope with urbanization pressures. To achieve urban sustainability objectives, the notion of a “smart city” becomes a promising policy option. Yet, little is known about the emergence of smart urban solutions in the African context. Analyzing Accra City Extension Project (ACEP)—an urban strategy for urbanization pressures in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana, this chapter contributes to understandings of the “how” and “why” particular smart urban solutions emerge and are adopted in African cities. Through in-depth interviews and document analysis, the findings indicate that multiple rationalities, including achieving orderly and efficient spatial development, infrastructure provision, liveability, land value capture, and inclusive urban development underpin the production of ACEP. Multiple actors such as central and local governments, traditional authorities, landowners, technocrats, private developers, residents, and transnational organizations with varied interests were involved in ACEP. To private investors and landowners, economic values were the main motivations; however, this is contrary to the general project visions of promoting urban sustainability and social inclusion. There was evidence of parallel and conflicting institutional arrangement for the project implementation. It is concluded that the project risks not achieving its aim of creating a sustainable, inclusive, and liveable urban environment, and at worst, it might become an urban fantasy plan that deepens inequality and marginalization.}

There has been the unprecedented increase in annual installation of wind turbines reaching 60 GW for the first time in history from 51.7 GW of wind energy installation in 2014. Most of the high-power installations utilized double-fed induction generators (DFIG) due to low power losses, which reduced the cost of power converters required in the circuit. Nevertheless, natural factors, such as varying wind speed, influence the output of generators which results in the unsteady generation of power thus affecting the stability of the system. A neural network-based DFIG integrated with super capacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is proposed in this paper. Modeling and simulation have been carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and the observations indicate the significant improvement in the stability of the system.}

The current development of cities integrates technological implementation, the adoption of social media, and “smart” practices to interact with users and tourists, influencing their travel choices by offering a highly technological and customized environment. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of digital technology implementation and social media platforms in cities on tourism flow. Based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach and relying on panel data considering 20 Italian smart city projects between 2011 and 2021, this paper demonstrates the extent of the relationship between digital technology implementation embedded in smart city development and tourist flow. Moreover, it also considers the effect of the amplitude of social media platforms adopted, which positively impacts this relationship. Thus, our findings suggest that digital technology implementation in cities generally influences the interplay between smart city and tourism trajectories. Additionally, a city's ability to respond to and implement the newest and trending social media significantly influences its local tourist attractiveness.}

SMART can therefore be used by city leaders to support decision-making toward truly smart cities. The chapter describes Strand One of SMART: the analysis of documented initiatives filtered through four liveability lenses (societal, environmental, economic, and governance). Initiatives are explored as to whether they deliver direct and indirect impacts in support of actions that aim to deliver liveability, their timescale, and their reach in terms of impact on the local population. In support of this research a high-level analysis shows the number of primary impacts (direct) and secondary impacts (indirect) from Singapore’s smart initiatives, and importantly where an action toward liveability is not impacted at all.}

There are other important influences including: the antecedents of policy and guidelines for green public transport planning - especially transit oriented development (TOD); and the closely aligned “smart city” movement. Adaptability of exogenous ideas to local circumstances is paramount. A generic planning and evaluation process is proposed that has been derived from the TOD/smart city investigations and professional practice undertaken by the authors. The meaning of cultural borrowings is explained using a case study of the history of urban planning and transport in Japan. Transit oriented development (TOD) and cultural borrowings are linked with examples from Sydney, Australia, and from selected Japanese cities. Fieldwork and interviews in Japan has led to the formulation of five elements (accessibility, amenity, access, affordability and ancestry), together with their associated planning objectives and (site-specific) issues.}

abstract = {A smart city (SC) is a modernized urban community, which incorporates information and communication technology (ICT) into the existing physical infrastructure. It offers reliable and uninterrupted services such as-intelligent transport and energy conservation to its residents. Among the various services offered, a continuous and widespread supply of electricity draws the maximum attention. Moreover, a substantial amount of this electricity is utilized by heating and cooling loads, making them significant contributors of global warming. Keeping focus on these points, a SC is modeled in this paper, wherein electricity consumption is minimized by modifying the traditional heating and cooling system. The proposed system collects solar heat and recovers industrial waste heat to deliver heating and cooling services to the SC residents. For the purpose of storing the heat energy, a seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) system has been proposed. The proposed STES system supplies stored thermal energy to heat-driven cooling and heating equipments. Moreover, central energy management system (CEMS) is also modeled for monitoring, regulating and controlling the flow of thermal energy. The designed CEMS consists of a Fuzzy rough set controller for scheduling heat to cater the instantaneous thermal energy requirements. Fuzzy rough set has been used because it eliminates the issues of vagueness, uncertainty, and ensures efficient real-time computations. Results depict that the heat energy obtained from solar thermal collectors and industrial wastes is able to meet the requirements of the SC after scheduling it using Fuzzy rough set algorithm.}

However, a significant cross-country heterogeneity with respect to the perception, implementation, and outcomes of smart governance can be observed. This chapter discusses the application of a smart tool for recognizing neighborhood satisfaction implemented in Lublin (Poland). The chapter also presents broader patterns in “smart city” development in Poland and then specifically in Lublin. In this way, it contributes to the discussion on addressing intra-urban inequalities, seen as a part of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The data was gathered from residents who took part in online voting on participatory budget projects and who were asked to assess the public amenities in their neighborhoods. Given the fact that the participants accounted for 2% of the urban population, the research allows us to recognize differences in neighborhood satisfaction within urban areas—a problem that is difficult to address empirically and thus rarely explored, yet critical in efforts to make urban areas more inclusive and sustainable. The results show that Lublin is not affected by strong spatial inequalities in terms of residential satisfaction with public goods provision, while existing moderate differences concern mainly infrastructure for urban mobility, air quality, and sports facilities and amenities. We identify some spatial patterns in neighborhood satisfaction and compare the results with insights from objective data. We also consider how our tool might contribute to the “smart governance” concept and to the sustainable spatial development of urban areas.}

In order to enhance its efficiency, sigma points would make a transformation which can make the model more stable and precise.

Many studies considered this problem and how it influences our life. This increases emissions and energy consumption and wastes people’s times as they try to find a free space for their cars. People normally become exhausted all over the day to reach their destination which causes stress and make them lose their temper. This would have a bad impact on the quality of life and economy. Based on the above, today people expect technology to address this problem and hence find a suitable solution to end the suffering of motorists. On the other hand, IoT is a promising platform for providing unusual applications for helping people and provide them a better way to manage their day’s lives. This work proposes a solution for a green intelligent parking system based on IoT. This solution is supported by proposing the game theory mathematical model. Game theory is used to model a reservation system of the proposed car parking solution. This work tackles the main problems facing car drivers to find available car parking spaces. These problems include: the parking fees, how far the car park from the car drivers destinations and hence the amount of walking, and the parking duration. Moreover, the proposed solution encourages companies and householders to offer their own parking stalls and/or driveways for renting in the unused times. From one hand, this will help on providing more parking lots specially in the dense traffic areas. On the other hand, the owners will get a revenue of their unused assets. Therefore, this work proposes a solution to parking problems by providing affordable parking lots based on the choice of the car driver that is relatively close to the destination. As a result of that, there will not be wasting of time or energy, frustration and panic will be reduced, fewer traffic jams, and consequently a green environment and a better quality of life.}

This will imply a shift of the energy demand from the oil sector to the electric energy utilities, and hence the development of an adequate recharge infrastructure to meet the electricity demand from electric vehicles. Moreover, the full integration of electric vehicles within future smart cities will call for the development of new Vehicle-to-Grid applications, enabling the grid operators and end-users to dynamically interact with the vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how driving patterns and data mining can be used for the design of a smart recharge infrastructure and for identifying Vehicle-to-Grid hot-spots over vast geographical areas. The analysis relies on a database of approximately 16,000 vehicles and 2.6 million of parking events, interfaced with an electric vehicle model and two recharge behavioural models. The results help to understand to which extent battery electric vehicles can replace conventional fuel cars under real-world constraints, quantifying their electric energy demand and their recursive parking locations, to design a customised recharge infrastructure and identify Vehicle-to-Grid hot-spots. This paper provides a description of the developed model, analysing its potential and limitations and underlining its possible future applications for smart cities, providing new insights towards the definition, assessment and development of future energy and transport policy.}

The author suggests a system-integrated point of view which has the concept “occupation/profession field” used both analytically and classifying. Three function modes being connected with each other are conceived on the basis of an activity theoretical approach. The target audience of these skills for the balanced assessment and consultation of developments in technical occupation fields embraces at least three relevant groups of people: (1) Vocational teachers should be able to represent technical work processes embedded in organizational, social and institutional conditions. Through this they can let future occupational profiles flow into their didactic long-term objectives. (2) The trainees themselves should be able to adapt their professional ideas to the complex and dynamic requirements of the globalization. Through these they become neither passive nor naive professional addressees since they also install contradictions meaning-orientedly in possible future scenarios. (3) The education/training management opens its perception and gates for junctions to thick institutional and social system partners to be able to guarantee the education of their trainees in different system contexts. The presented model is explained at the example of the Smart City approach which helps for the worldwide putting through of an ecologically and economically acceptable lifestyle in the metropolises of the 21st century.}

This research seeks to identify possible barriers hindering Accra as a city from becoming a SEC and prioritizing these barriers based on both importance with consideration of interactions between barriers using a two-step Decision Making, Trial and Evaluation Laboratory under fuzzy set environment i.e. two-step fuzzy DEMATEL. For Accra, the results indicate that market barriers are the most important barriers while limited access to capital has the highest global importance score in the whole SEC barriers system. Besides, technology barriers, policy barriers and market barriers are found as cause barriers and high cost of technology dispatches more impact on other barriers in technology barriers category. High interest rate and unstable currency, inadequate infrastructure requiring huge investments, insufficient legal and regulatory framework, high cost of technology and lack of information about cost and benefits of renewable energy technology are deserved to be paid more attention since they have both high important and cause indexes. The result is to enhance strategic decision making since this combination of methods deals with the possible human sentiments in decision making and also organizes barriers into cause and effect groups based on their interactions, with the cause groups been critical since their presence can give rise to effect group barriers.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a secure blockchain based energy trading system for residential homes. In the system, a new proof-of-computational closeness (PoCC) consensus protocol is proposed for the selection of miners and the creation of blocks. Moreover, an analytical energy pricing policy is designed to solve the problem of existing energy pricing policies in a distributed trading environment. A dynamic multi-pseudonym mechanism is developed for the prosumers to preserve their transactional privacy during energy trading. Since it requires extra storage and computing resources for the blockchain miners to simultaneously execute both mining process and application intensive tasks, therefore, an improved sparse neural network (ISNN) is proposed for computation offloading to the cloud servers. In ISNN, a Jaya optimization algorithm is used to accelerate the error convergence rate while reducing the number of connections between different layers of neurons. Besides, ISNN optimizes the overall computational cost of the system. Furthermore, the security of the prosumers is ensured using blockchain technology while security analysis shows that the system is robust against the Sybil attack. The proposed blockchain based peer-to-peer secure energy trading system is extremely important for sustainable cities and society. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed pricing policy is compared with time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing and real-time pricing policies. From the results, it is proved that the prosumers achieve a higher degree of satisfaction and utility when using the proposed pricing policy. Moreover, the probability of a successful Sybil attack is zero as the number of attackers’ identities and computational capacities increases. Under different sizes of data to be uploaded, the proposed ISNN scheme has the least average computational cost and data transmission time as compared to deep reinforcement learning combined with genetic algorithm (DRGO) and sparse evolutionary training and multi-layer perceptron (SET-MLP) schemes in the literature. Moreover, the proposed system is tested for scalability by increasing the number of prosumers. Extensive simulations are performed and the results depict the satisfactory performance of the proposed system.}

In this paper, a novel block Discrete Cosine Transform (BDCT) coefficients feature distribution based statistical approach is proposed to discover image forgeries for image splicing measurement. In the proposed feature, all the BDCT neighbouring modes are categorized into a number of groups following the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion to ensure the modes in the same group having similar distributions. For each group, the transition probability matrix (TPM) or the joint probability matrix (JPM) is extracted from the BDCT coefficient pairs in the image. Moreover, the proposed scheme is constructed by concatenating all the TPM/JPM features for each group. Experimental results demonstrate that our feature outperforms two state-of-the-art approaches when taking both the measurement accuracy and feature dimension into consideration.}

A progressive paradigm shift will change everything from the fuel type to the way of driving vehicles. Vehicles will progressively become autonomous and will communicate and cooperate with each other. In the long run, profound changes are expected in mobility as a service. Furthermore, urban areas will have a higher level of development, and cities will likely turn into Smart Cities in which the vehicles will interact with the urban infrastructure. The main objective of this paper is to explore the macroscopic effects of mobility interaction in a radial-circular urban road system for current and future cities (Smart Cities). In the literature, there is documentation of the direct effects of autonomous vehicles, but some indirect effects will cause undesirable impacts such as an increase in demand and more congestion, which change the demand behavior and the urban structure. Finally, this paper exhibits the results of direct and indirect effects calculated through analytical tools (Continuous Approximation Method). In fact, our research shows that if demand increases by about 50%, the current scenario could have the same total cost as the future scenario with autonomous vehicles. Moreover, if the city radius increases by about 33% and the subjective value of time decreases about 20%, the benefits of the autonomous cars will be compensated. Therefore, the paper proves that autonomous vehicles could encourage the urban sprawl in the long run. Finally, Administrations should define transport strategies and policies to control these externalities, because autonomous driving could deteriorate mobility even worse than it is now.}

A large number of application areas and technologies are utilized in smart cities to achieve complex interactions between citizens, city departments, and third parties. This great complexity is one reason why privacy protection only seldom comes into the picture. A violation of privacy can result in discrimination and social sorting. Moreover, recent advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) have demanded much of cloud services in respect to sharing users’ private data. Data from various organizations are the vital information source for analysis and research. Generally, this sensitive or private data involves information related to medical records, census data, voter registration, social networks, and customer services. A primary concern of cloud service providers in data publishing is to hide the sensitive information of individuals. One of the cloud services that fulfils these confidentiality concerns is privacy preserving data mining (PPDM). The PPDM service in cloud computing (CC) enables data publishing with minimized distortion and absolute privacy. In this method, datasets are anonymized via generalization to meet privacy requirements. However, the well-known privacy-preserving data mining technique called K-anonymity suffers from several limitations. To surmount those shortcomings, we propose a new heuristic anonymization framework for preserving the privacy of sensitive datasets when publishing in the cloud for smart cities. The advantages of K-anonymity, L-diversity, and (α, k)-anonymity methods for efficient information utilization and privacy protection are emphasized. Experimental results have revealed the superior performance of these techniques.}

WM involves a set of processes ranging from waste collection to the recycling of the collected materials. The proliferation of sensors and actuators enable the new era of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be adopted in SCs and help in WM. Novel approaches that involve dynamic routing models combined with the IoT capabilities could provide solutions that outperform existing models. In this paper, we focus on a SC where a number of collection bins are located in different areas with sensors attached to them. We study a dynamic waste collection architecture, which is based on data retrieved by sensors. We pay special attention to the possibility of immediate WM service in high priority areas, e.g., schools or hospitals where, possibly, the presence of dangerous waste or the negative effects on human quality of living impose the need for immediate collection. This is very crucial when we focus on sensitive groups of citizens like pupils, elderly or people living close to areas where dangerous waste is rejected. We propose novel algorithms aiming at providing efficient and scalable solutions to the dynamic waste collection problem through the management of the trade-off between the immediate collection and its cost. We describe how the proposed system effectively responds to the demand as realized by sensor observations and alerts originated in high priority areas. Our aim is to minimize the time required for serving high priority areas while keeping the average expected performance at high level. Comprehensive simulations on top of the data retrieved by a SC validate the proposed algorithms on both quantitative and qualitative criteria which are adopted to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We claim that, local authorities could choose the model that best matches their needs and resources of each city.}

Maintenance of these servers under dynamic scenarios while ensuring scalability and performance demands Software Defined Networks (SDNs) for easy and efficient resource management. This paper addresses the QoS requirement and energy-efficient operation for Software-Defined DCs for resource management by means of (i) selectively activating a subset of switches, (ii) propounding multi-path routing for all scheduled flows, (iii) aggregating data and routing structure to avoid network congestion and (iv) installation of appropriate forwarding rules across the network switches. These issues are collectively put together in the outline of ILP problem, but due to its computational complexity, a heuristic optimization approach called particle swarm intelligence is articulated. The particle swarm intelligence (PSI) algorithm is employed for feature selection to obtain the minimum cost of the generated energy while satisfying the network traffic demand.

Noise levels can be collected and analyzed using a wireless sensor network which can monitor the noise level by using microphones. However, every wireless system struggles in terms of the battery requirements needed for continuous data collection and monitoring. In this paper, the design of a testbed for a smart microphone system is presented. To save power, a microcontroller and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) dynamically switch between high and low power modes in response to environmental noise. Specifically, the high powered components are triggered by a spike in the acoustic noise level. Three wireless technologies, WiFi (2.4 GHz), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 and Zigbee were examined. According to the results, the power consumption of a node can be lowered by 97% when idle based on the testbed.}

New technological options such as passive buildings, bio-methane injection into grids, small scale CHP with heat storage and PV driven heat pumps for heat provision alter common strategies to supply larger settlements. As energy options become more diverse, heat integration of industry into cities becomes important from economic and ecological considerations. Stabilising distribution grids in the face of diverging supply and demand profiles will further complicate planning of smart city projects. In the face of these challenges, innovative planning tools will gain importance. This paper will discuss using the P-Graph method in its application to sustainable technology systems. This method will be used to generate optimal energy systems linking industry to smart cities and to integrate innovative energy technologies into such systems. The Sustainable Process Index will be used to evaluate these systems from the ecological sustainability point of view. This sustainability measure is particularly well suited to differentiate between conventional fossil based and renewable source based energy systems. A real life case study of the application of these methods to the challenge of designing the optimal energy system for a smart city will be discussed in the paper. The case study deals with a green field development in a medium sized city in Austria (Graz). This project includes different energy provision sources (e.g. excess heat from industry, ground water energy), low energy buildings and innovative storage and energy provision technologies.}

On purpose, Smartphone technologies and platforms are rapidly becoming effective tools for involving citizens in environmental conscious mobility habits. By means of an empirical application to a group of university students, that daily commute for reaching their departments, the effectiveness of a mobile app game in pursuing commuters to modify their mobility behaviors is here checked. The game rewards with tangible prizes the most environmentally sustainable mobility habits, connecting commuters with sponsors and companies operating in the urban context. The field application of the app in the city of Palermo challenges the involved commuters against two benchmarks of mobility behaviors characterized by the use of higher sweet mobility means. The first scenario (apart its applicability as alone) can be seen as a first less challenging step towards the second one. The interesting outcomes of this experimental application encourage paying further attention to such behavioral tools for achieving the smartness of cities.}

abstract = {The New Human Condition (NHC) is perhaps the largest cognitive challenge in history to human intelligence and agency and concerns our species' ability to cope with the consequences and responsibilities of being the major driver of planetary change in the twenty-first century (Pálsson et al., 2013, Holm et al., 2015). But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition.}

Hence, locally suitable Green Index should be devised and incorporated in the urban planning of cities, in spite of the size of the city. This analysis is to showcase the green index for the planning of smart cities. The devised green index is verified in the real-world context of Gulbarga city, India, thereby understanding the practicality of this index. The results show scope for alternative green cover, where ever the green index is low. This technique presents intra-city green cover pattern analysis. Such analysis emphasises to reserve the space for green in urban planning for well-being in totality. The aspect of Land Surface Temperature (LST) analysis and correlating the same with the amount of green cover further enhances the process of promoting green cities. The assessment of per capita green space with the standards of World Health Organisation (WHO) identified the scope of greenery initiatives in various parts of the city.}

This chapter presents a survey of emerging datasets for urban traffic monitoring. This discussion begins by drawing comparisons with pavement management systems, an area of roadway management that was one of the earliest areas where wide-scale data collection initiated. Traffic monitoring is following a similar development path toward pervasive data collection, but the task is more challenging because of the highly dynamic nature of traffic. Historically, traffic data consisted mainly of counting data with limited deployments of speed sensors. More recently, new datasets have emerged that are transforming the ability of transportation agencies to manage highway systems. In traffic signal systems, the arrival of high-resolution data has provided a means of evaluating the quality of traffic control in richer detail than was before possible. Meanwhile, vehicle tracking has become commonplace with use of automatic vehicle identification (AVI) and automatic vehicle location (AVL), and several tools using such data are now used by many agencies. Another currently emergent type of data consists of vehicle sensor information collected through vehicle telematics. Auto manufacturers have already begun to deploy the equipment in new vehicles and are currently working on aggregating data from these. In future, automated vehicles are likely to require even more intense use of sensors so that the vehicles, their users, and other intelligent systems can react to emerging situations more effectively.}

Based on the development history of EI, this paper introduces regional energy internet(REI) from two aspects of research scope and main characteristics. At the same time, based on reviewing the graph theory(GT) and CNA’s application in energy-related domain, it summarizes the particularity of coupling interconnection between transportation network and social network in REI. The concept of energy self-organization(ESO) and energy community(EC) is introduced based on self-organization theory, meanwhile, the differences and advantages between ESO and previous similar concepts are summarized and compared. On this basis, the key issues of REI are analyzed from the perspective of ECs, including complex network topology modeling, optimal network flow allocation, coordination and complementary control, cascade failure mechanism(the scale of different failures can be enlarged through interdependence) analysis and multi-agent interest interaction game. Meanwhile, main research challenges are summarized and the future work is prospected. Finally, the paper conclude the work and deficiencies—it provides a theoretical basis for realizing a city’s collaborative optimization, independent autonomy and efficient low-carbon operation, and improves the application of CNA in urban REI research.}

The IoT industry system has also gradually improved, forming a complete industrial foundation, including chips, electronic components, equipment, software, integrated systems, IoT services, and telecom operators. In the event of selective forwarding attacks, virus damage, malicious virus intrusion, etc., the losses caused by such security problems are more serious than those of traditional networks, which are not only network information materials, but also physical objects. The limitations of sensor node resources in the Internet of Things, the complexity of networking, and the open wireless broadcast communication characteristics make it vulnerable to attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps identify anomalies in the network and takes the necessary countermeasures to ensure the safe and reliable operation of IoT applications. This paper proposes an IoT feature extraction and intrusion detection algorithm for intelligent city based on deep migration learning model, which combines deep learning model with intrusion detection technology. According to the existing literature and algorithms, this paper introduces the modeling scheme of migration learning model and data feature extraction. In the experimental part, KDD CUP 99 was selected as the experimental data set, and 10% of the data was used as training data. At the same time, the proposed algorithm is compared with the existing algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has shorter detection time and higher detection efficiency.}

Cloud computing, as a burgeoning technology of the ICT, provides consumers with unlimited computing capabilities and storage resources. Using the cloud to promote the progress of the ICT-based applications meets the requirement of the practical usage, and is also in line with the sustainable development. As we all know, the secret sharing is a hot topic in the security community. Many security-assurance applications can be realized with the assistance of secret sharing. In this paper, an efficient cloud-aided verifiable secret sharing scheme is proposed based on the polynomial commitment for smart cities, which can be used in a variety of practical applications such as electronic voting and revocable electronic cash. In the proposed scheme, users can verify the received shares from the cloud. Moreover, in order to meet the requirement of the real-world usage, we extend our scheme to support the batch verification with the aid of a third-party arbitration center. In addition, the aggregate signature is used to verify whether a subset of users possess the shares that indeed sent by the cloud. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements of the verifiable secret sharing (VSS) and the performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient than previous schemes in terms of the communication and the computation.}

abstract = {As the frequency of disasters increases worldwide, resilience planning through disaster management has become critical. Disaster managers must make difficult decisions prioritizing various disaster evacuation routes with limited road resources. This study proposes a road network reconfiguration (RnR) framework for disaster evacuation planning. The proposed model proposes a method to reconfigure a road network that can consider various factors based on open-source geographical information systems data. The proposed model first presents a big data processing method for generating an evacuation plan from actual large-scale road network data. This method is adopted for effective routes for large objects. Second, the proposed framework derives routes by disaster risk and is not limited to the minimum route cost, ensuring an optimal safe route according to the degree of risk. As a result, the proposed RnR framework contributes to the resilience of cities by enabling decision-makers and executives in disaster management to design action plans to avoid city risks and conserve human resources.}

abstract = {Designing a future smart city (FSC) that copes with the reduction of CO2 has become one of the urgent tasks of the next 20years. One promising approach to achieve FSC is to combine appropriate land use (compact city with energy efficient buildings and photovoltaic panels (PVs)), transportation (electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation system) and energy systems (smart grid systems), because of the interaction between these elements. However, there are few models which simulate these elements in an integrated manner. This paper presents the concept of the integrated model, and shows the land use-energy part of the model created for the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is the largest Mega city in the world. Firstly, a spatially explicit land use model (urban economic model) is constructed for the study area, and the model is calibrated using existing statistical data. Secondly, possible future compact/dispersion city scenarios for the year 2050 are created using the model. Thirdly, intra-day dynamics (hourly) of electricity demand and supply from PVs, which is assumed to be installed to the roofs of all detached houses in the study area, under two urban scenarios is simulated. The obtained results suggest that [1] “compact” urban form may contribute to the reduction of electricity demand from the residential sector, but [2] PV-supply under the scenario may also be reduced because of the decreased share of detached houses. Hence in the compact city scenario, it is important to discuss the effective use of vacant areas in suburbs, which may be used for large PV installations, or be re-vegetated to mitigate urban heat island effects.}

It continues by presenting a general overview of the perspectives and issues of Data and Open Data with specific implications for cities and the public sector. It discusses whether and how Open Data can promote more participative and collaborative forms of governance. The extension of Open Data by Linked Data and Linked Open/Government Data is described. The value chain of Open Data in cities with its set of activities is discussed. Whether Open Data needs to be free, the data formats used to make data Open, the kinds of licenses used, and the challenges posed by Open Data projects and initiatives are described. The path taken by a few nations with their Open Data portals is briefly covered to introduce the progress behind the theory. The benefits of sharing data even between departments, and the impact the successful implementation of services has on another department, is then explored and illustrated by way of relevant scenarios. The chapter concludes by presenting the possibilities for cities to create data market places from which they may derive additional revenue and commercial value.}

abstract = {An effective performance enhancement model for the thin film solar cell conjointly based on extraordinary transmission and nanoantenna is proposed and investigated. The absorber layer of the extraordinary transmission based solar cell contains a metallic thin film with periodic holes. Maximum extraordinary transmission is accomplished as the metallic film has the same refractive index on both sides. Increased light transmission causes the absorber layer to absorb more light, which increases short circuit current density and subsequently the efficiency of the thin film solar cell. The presented analysis demonstrates that adding a square nano patch on the top surface of the absorber layer can further boost the extraordinary transmission. The extraordinary transmission is increased because of the formation of cavity nanoantenna. Cavity nanoantenna increases the coupling of light into the hole due to the excitation of surface plasmons polaritons. The proposed design of solar cell exhibits around 98% absorption and the short circuit current density is increased by a factor of 3.23. The study has been carried out using finite difference time domain (FDTD) method.}

Although there are few differences between green energy and renewable energy, it is derived from regenerative energy sources. These energy sources don't harm the environment by, for example, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In fact, blockchain is expected to drastically change the renewable energy sector in a number of ways, including certifying the source of green energy by assigning generation assets to a particular point of consumption, increasing accessibility to energy grids through real-time data sharing, and facilitating a transaction between two parties (n.d.). Blockchain technology has the potential to change green finance in light of the pressing need for climate solutions and the importance of transparency and traceable data in measurement and monitoring.}

abstract = {Social web has transformed healthcare communication as patients reach out to seek support and advice by connecting with other patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. The influx of health-related queries and the volume of answers within the medical forums is a testimony to this adaption. The scalability, natural interaction and dynamism of the continuously collected and connected user-generated social big data can support health assessment, intervention and provisioning to produce the best kind of cognitive smart city. On the flip side the use of social media for healthcare communication suffers from data deluge, lack of reliability and quality, confidentiality and privacy (location/personal) issues. Duplicate questions, that is, queries with similar semantics (meaning) corrupt the filtering mechanism, increase the response time and compromise with the quality of the answer too. This research puts forward solutions to resolve the key challenge of duplicacy within the medical community Question-Answering sites (Medical CQAs). We propose to solve the semantic question matching problem for duplicate question pair detection, using a hybrid deep learning model, which combines a Co-attention based Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Siamese neural network and a Multi-layer perceptron classifier to output the probability of a similarity match between the two questions. Euclidean distance function is then used to compute the similarity between questions. The proposed model is validated on 100 question pairs which are scrapped from three featured groups, namely, ‘Irritable Bowel Syndrome’, ‘Anxiety Disorder’ and ‘Menopause’ of Patient.info community forum and an accuracy of 86.375% is observed. The results obtained are comparable to that of the Quora’s state-of-the-art results for duplicate detection.}

With this goal health monitoring of elderly and disabled people have got plenty of attention and focus in the research. The healthcare systems rely on the components responsible for context sensing, processing, storage and inference, and response. In order to make the interoperability among the various healthcare systems, a typical standard is needed in order to uniformly access the context-aware healthcare information coming through a fundamental infrastructure. In this paper, we propose people-centric sensing framework for the healthcare of elderly and disabled people. Such platform is aimed to monitor health of the elderly and disabled person and provide them with a service oriented emergency response in case of abnormal health condition. We focus on three aspects: (a) context manipulation from the mobile device in people-centric environment; (b) emergency response using context base information; and (c) modeling mobile context sources as services. The most distinctive feature of current work is that medical resources are efficiently used to provide them real-time medical services in case of emergency simultaneously extending social network of the elderly people. The system implementation shows that the proposed people-centric sensing system is efficient and cost-effective in health and emergency care.}

This huge growth of the population has pressurized countries to regulate and manage resources in the cities. Cities provide the richest of opportunities, are accelerators for social changes, promote innovation, have connected infrastructure, and easily adopt technology, with the capacity to scale up. However, these cities are burdened with issues like handling urban wastes, conserve fossil fuels, facilitating affordable and timely healthcare systems, providing efficient traffic management, and transparency in governance. These concerns gave birth to the innovative, technology-based, and sustainable urban spaces called Sustainable Smart City (SSC). SSC experiments deploy technologies to monitor its community and provide sustainable and affordable solutions. SSC employs the technologies to monitor its community and provide sustainable and affordable solutions to the urban spaces. The successful deployment of the SSC’s demands a stable, secure, interoperable, and reliable telecommunication network, to support applications and services in urban areas. The recent developments in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technology assure to drive and support this development of SSC’s. This chapter gives an insight into the elements of the SSCs, the overview of its adaption by the cities worldwide, and its future trends.}
