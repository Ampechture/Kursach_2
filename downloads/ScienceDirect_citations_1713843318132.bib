abstract = {Our cities are being redefined daily based on social, political and environmental factors. This creates substantial challenges for those that attempt to develop resilience strategies for cities. Resilience planning requires a set of assumptions often based on data; however, the dynamic nature of our growing urban environments has impeded our ability to rely on these suppositions. To account for the unpredictable ebb and flow of changes in our cities we have become heavily dependent on data modeling and analytics. The ability to collect and store data from a variety of systems in a cloud infrastructure has enabled the potential for resilience planning to be based on historical scenarios and societal context – prioritizing risks and issues based on multiple factors. As our infrastructure becomes “smarter” with the ability to capture more data and make decisions through machine learning algorithms, resilience plans may become less in touch with the citizens for whom the resilience strategies exist. Thusly, an emergent risk to the inhabitants of cities is the imbalance of qualitative versus quantitative feedback that is leveraged to develop and improve a city's resilience strategy. Cities are living organisms that cannot be purely defined through machine data. A modern way to establish policies and plans for major urban centers is to leverage machine data collected through various “smart” technology programs. Such data-aggregation mechanisms feed into analytics tools that often fail to account for historical context or citizens’ perspectives. Without leveraging this information, a resilience plan cannot be complete as it will not address the city as a system, but only a component thereof. This paper proposes a new model for developing a city's comprehensive resilience strategy that integrates machine data, historical context and societal effects. The risk of not pursuing a three-pronged model would be that future resilience strategies would lack a human-centric approach.}

Specifically, we propose the creation of a new street type that will be strictly devoted to pedestrians, cyclists, ABs and micromobility modes (e.g. e-scooters), through a data-driven approach. The proposed method consists of five steps and takes into consideration various criteria referring both to urban (e.g. population density, school facilities, public spaces, commercial sites) and transport environment (e.g. roadway width, slopes). It is carried out by using GIS tools. The study area of the research is the city of Kallithea, a densely populated suburb in the southern part of Athens. The suggested planning approach is expected to shape favourable conditions for improving public transport efficiency and visibility by gradually incorporating low-speed, electric, pod-like ABs in a car-dominated system and providing them with a test-bed that will prepare them for their expansion to highway environments, where they would really make a difference in the long term. This is something that adds to the bigger picture of sustainable and socially inclusive transport provision even if route planning implementation is a challenging issue, since ABs should be integrated in the transport network, along with pedestrians and cyclists. The development of a method which introduces ABs in the urban transport system is in line with the emerging Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept, and it also contributes considerably to the shift from conventional to smart cities.}

The objective of this research is to show the opportunity that implementation of zero emission ferry lines offers in the framework of 100% RES smart island energy systems and demonstrate their ability to supply the fuel for zero emission ferry lines. A method is presented for modelling supply of ferry lines, which are fuelled from excess energy produced by local renewable energy sources. Case study analyses show that operation costs of hydrogen and electric ferry differ depending on the island size and route. Onshore investments are 60% lower in case of electric ferry for short lines, while for longer line onshore investments were up to 4 times higher than the ones needed for the hydrogen ferry line, which had 40% smaller onboard investment costs.}

The tendency of enterprises to use open innovations can be seen in the literature in many areas of research and practical application. However, the use of the concept of open innovation in local administration entities is less noticeable. The research gap in this area prompts the authors to examine such a tendency among city representatives in the example of the Tourism Friendly Cities (TFC) group. TFC is a group of nine tourism destinations that are also European cities struggling with the impact of modern tourism. They take part in the URBACT program under the European Territorial Cooperation program. The goal of the article is to identify the basic problems of TFCs with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess the propensity of TFC representatives to transfer innovative solutions in the form of open innovation. The article presents findings based on interviews with 104 experts from these cities, consisting of representatives of the public and private sectors. Research results indicate that the key problems of modern tourism in TFCs include constraints related to the lack of parking spaces, high rents and high prices of land, and short-term rental housing. The experts recommend measures to increase resilience and competitiveness initiated by business owners and at the initiative of the local administration. Key tools in this regard include and local community communication and engagement, creating attractions that benefit both residents and visitors, and measuring and monitoring tourism. In all, 92.8% of the experts believe that the right solution for the development of methods and tools for stakeholder cooperation in TFCs is to share the developed solutions in the form of open innovation.}

Blockchain was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and developers all around the world have been trying to apply blockchain in different areas, like finance services, credit and ownership management, resource sharing, investment management, Internet of things (IoT), and so on. Ethereum is a blockchain 2.0 platform that allows developers to build a decentralized application (DApp) without building a new blockchain from scratch. IoT is the technology to embed all physical devices with sensors and chips to provide automation via machine-to-machine communication. Blynk is a platform that provides iOS and Android applications for users and developers to collect data from microcontroller. Our goal in this chapter is to build a blockchain-based, DApp named Uranus for smart building system management with private Ethereum blockchain, Raspberry Pi (RPi), Blynk platform, and sensors (e.g., DHT11). The blockchain technology in Uranus provides three benefits: (1) it is tamper-resistant, (2) it has no single point of failure, and (3) it is trusted and auditable. The system is a proof-of-concept (PoC) system prototype to simulate smart building applications. It collects real-time building temperature and humidity through a DHT11 sensor via RPi. The sensor data is updated to the Blynk app and stored on the smart contract deployed on the private Ethereum blockchain. If the real-time temperature or humidity value exceeds the threshold value set by the users, red or green LEDs will be turned on as warnings and then an air conditioner or dehumidifier will be turned on. We build a PoC smart building system to verify its feasibility and demonstrate its performance based on a simulated testbed.}

This constellation of small, & smart telescopes could also enhance and supplement data generated by the small number of large telescopes operating today. Unistellar initiated a partnership with the SETI Institute to identify and implement scientific applications for a network of eVscopes. We summarize in this article the technology behind the eVscope and its real-time data processing (Enhanced Vision, Automatic Field Detection), then show several applications accessible to future users, including asteroid occultations, the detection of the atmosphere of Pluto and observations of near-Earth asteroids.

Since the system uses available technologies, it is envisioned as a part of transition towards net-zero sustainable economy. At the core of the system is production of hydrogen via pyrolysis of methane which has recently achieved technological maturity of industrial scale production. Natural gas combustion in a combined heat and power (CHP) unit produces electrical and thermal energy required by the city and by the energy system itself. CO2 produced by CHP is captured via MEA absorption and converted to methanol via synthesis with hydrogen while also producing carbon black. We consider different carbon reduction scenarios, urbanization levels, system operation conditions, operational costs, capital costs, and energy and material prices in evaluating the system. If such systems are deployed worldwide, subject to produced methanol being equal to the current demand (111 Million ton/yr), they would eliminate 44 Million t/yr CO2 emissions from existing methanol plants and 160 Millon t/yr CO2 emissions from standalone energy systems that provide heating and cooling for 40 Million people.}

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes invasive infections and is associated with community-acquired infections (CAIs) and hospital-associated infections (HAIs). In 2020, 315 S. aureus isolates, including 145 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 170 MRSA, mainly associated with bacteremia and mostly CAIs, were collected from 16 hospitals in different regions of Taiwan. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the Sensititre™ complete automated AST system. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types were analysed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The median age of patients infected with MRSA was significantly higher than that of patients infected with MSSA (72.5 years vs. 67.0 years, P=0.027). MIC50/MIC90 values of eravacycline and omadacycline were 0.06/0.12, and 0.25/0.5, respectively. Of the MRSA isolates, 4.1% presented susceptible dose-dependence to ceftaroline, most of which (85.7%) were HAI- and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-negative. Among the MRSA isolates, 7.1% were not susceptible to telavancin and tedizolid (mainly type IV, PVL-negative, and CAI), 0.6% were not susceptible to daptomycin (type III, PVL-negative, and HAI), and 1.8% were not susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin (three isolates were type III, IV, and VT, respectively, and all were PVL-negative), but all were susceptible to dalbavancin. In conclusion, patients with bacteremia caused by MRSA were older than those with bacteremia caused by MSSA, SCCmec type IV was more predominant in CAI than in HAI, and MRSA isolates not susceptible to novel anti-MRSA antimicrobials belonged to types II, III, or IV. Further studies that include comprehensive demographics and more detailed descriptions of other antimicrobial-resistant genes are urgently needed.}

This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.}

abstract = {The effect of diversification versus specialisation, as well as the technological proximity of R&D partners have been at the heart of innovation studies. Articles in this field either take a regional or company point of view. During the last few decades, studies on the relatedness of knowledge and its importance for innovation and commercialisation have pushed policy makers towards clustering strategies such as smart specialisation in the EU and the Innovation Supercluster Initiative in Canada. Interestingly, universities as the source of new knowledge and technologies have been absent from this literature as the focal point. This paper aims at filling one of the missing links between the literature on technological relatedness and university research commercialisation. We use patent and licence data from the USPTO and the AUTM survey to study the effect of patent portfolio composition on university research commercialisation. We use Shannon’s entropy index to differentiate between the effects of related and unrelated diversification on the number of licences generating income. Our results show a positive association of related diversification with the number of licences, but none for unrelated diversification. Furthermore, technological proximity follows an inverted-U shaped association with the number of licences generating income. However, the effect is observed only for smaller universities. We conclude that the curvilinear association is the result of cognitive distance and the absence of boundary spanners. Our findings indicate that regional policy makers intending to use universities as an engine for innovation and regional economic growth should consider policies and initiatives aimed at bridging the cognitive gap between university and industry by either increasing technological proximity or reducing cognitive distances by financing boundary spanning organisations.}

Despite this, sustainability principles and the importance of urban groundwater are lacking in future city visions. Using London as a case study, the importance of groundwater for cities is highlighted and a range of future city interventions may impact on groundwater are reviewed. Using data from water resource plans and city planning strategies, changes in the groundwater balance which may occur as a result of city interventions are calculated for two future city scenarios: a ‘strategic’ future informed by organisational policy and an ‘aspirational’ future guided by sustainability principles. For London, under a strategic future, preferential investment in industry-scale technologies such as wastewater treatment and groundwater storage would occur. Acknowledgement that behaviour change offers the potential for a faster rate of transformation than innovation technologies is ignored. The capacity of community-led action and smart-home technologies to deliver sustainable water use under an aspirational future is evident, with a measurable impact on urban groundwater. These methods may be used to inform city interventions that consider the social context in addition to environmental constraints and business drivers.}

A planning model based on CHP modelling is developed for the SHREC system. A linear programming (LP) algorithm is developed to optimize the SHREC system in a weekly period and the results are compared with an existing energy optimization software.

In Japan, incentive to install these units for consumers is provided by governmental support with the introduction of feed-in tariffs (FIT) and governmental subsidies. Thus, it is possible to reduce electricity cost in houses using time-of-use (TOU) price and to get benefit from selling power generated by PV. Furthermore, investment costs of PV and battery systems are decreasing year by year; on however, the price of purchased power for consumers is increasing and the selling price by FIT is decreasing annually. Hence, it is important to reveal which year, at what capacity, and which system and appliances are best choices for the consumer. In this paper, an expansion planning model of PV and battery systems for the smart house is presented. The expansion planning period is 20 years and ranges from 2015 to 2035. The proposed method clarifies the optimal installation year, capacity and appliances during the twenty year period considering variable characteristics such as investment cost, selling price and purchasing price which change year by year.}

Therefore, this paper adopts a multi-criterion cost objective, where minimum energy costs are required without sacrificing user preferences and satisfaction. Different type of loads are presented, including both thermostatically controllable loads (simulated and modelled in Energy Plus), and controllable electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). Extensive simulations showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method introducing comparisons with different strategies by exploiting renewable energy integration, varying pricing tariffs and the stored energy of EVs and ESS units. A robustness evaluation of the proposed method is presented, validating the performance under different conditions.

However, collecting every data of electric appliances needs many devices and it would be high costs. Therefore, data disaggregation from total data to each appliance leads to the reduction of cost and electricity. This paper presents how to disaggregate the consumption of electric appliances from total electricity consumption. In order to disaggregate electricity consumption of electric appliances from total energy consumption, sparse coding has been implemented. However, changes in the use of electric appliances are difficult to express in this method. Therefore, we propose a novel sparse coding method, named, “0-1 sparse coding” to disaggregate which electric appliances were used in the total consumption of electricity. In order to collected sample data for analyzing the methods, we installed smart metering systems in two households. The system collects the data of total electricity consumption and data in the main electric appliances in every 5-minutes. We evaluate two methods, 1) our proposed method, and 2) discriminative sparse coding method. From the results, our proposed method increased the accuracy about 44.8% than the previous method.}

In this paper an operational scheme for a better performance of the power distribution system in the presence of distributed generation (DG) has been proposed.

This information can be used in applications that control HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and lighting systems, or in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications which monitor the people's wellbeing. In our approach we use data from two simple sensors, passive infrared sensor (PIR) which monitors presence and hall effect sensor which monitors whether the door is opened or closed. This installation is non-intrusive and quite simple because the sensor node to which sensors are connected is battery powered, and no additional work to ensure power supply needs to be performed. Two approaches for activity detection are proposed, first based on a sliding window, and the other based on artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithms are tested on a dataset collected in our laboratory environment.}

In this research, we develop a stochastic analytical model for optimal control of communicant autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at smart intersections. We present the automated network fundamental diagram (ANFD) as a macro-level modeling tool for urban networks with smart intersections. In the proposed cooperative control strategy, we make use of the headway between the CAV platoons in each direction for consecutive passage of the platoons in the crossing direction through non-signalized intersections with no delay. For this to happen, the arrival and departure of platoons in crossing directions need to be synchronized. To improve system robustness (synchronization success probability), we allow a marginal gap between arrival and departure of the consecutive platoons in crossing directions to make up for operational error in the synchronization process. We then develop a stochastic traffic model for the smart intersections. Our results show that the effects of increasing the platoon size and the marginal gap length on the network capacity are not always positive. In fact, the capacity can be maximized by optimizing these cooperative control variables. We analytically solve the traffic optimization problem for the platoon size and marginal gap length and derive a closed-form solution for a normal distribution of the operational error. The performance of the network with smart intersections is presented by a stochastic ANFD, derived analytically and verified numerically using the results of a simulation model. The simulation results show that optimizing the control variables increases the capacity by 138% when the error standard deviation is 0.1 s.}

The new Socio-Technical Systems Engineering (STSE) process is proposed to guide improved design, and it is exemplified with a new real time service that provides integrated information for trip planning in a city. The STSE process supports a high level visual modelling approach assisted by model execution and simulation tools. From a service engineering perspective, the outcomes of this process are artefacts that automatically support consistency among design steps and effective integration of customer experience and stakeholder requirements through iterative cycles related to service design. The application of the STSE process in the design of an exploratory case study of a real time information and travel planning service is validated through simulation using an executable representation of requirements. It can be executed over more complex transport service offerings, with different resource allocation algorithms, or different public transport planning services over a sample of real users requesting information. Results of such a simulation are beneficial for the users, for the service providers, and for the authorities managing public transport in city or metropolitan areas.}

Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms are a cornerstone of smart cities and the sharing economy; their impact on place and placemaking is still largely untested, with evidence that an indiscriminate commercial focus on tourism growth can affect the habitability of cities and the quality of public space. This chapter presents a critical assessment to rethink the impact that peer-to-peer accommodation networks have on place experiences and placemaking, focusing on three themes: (a) the urban ecosystem, (b) place authenticity and “localhood,” and (c) a city’s diversity advantage. As a way to illustrate our argument and to ground it in an empirical case, we introduce firsthand place and tourism experiences from the city of Split in Croatia. We synthesize our argument across the three themes with a view to expand transdisciplinary knowledge into urban studies and smart cities. The chapter concludes with emerging recommendations for placemaking approaches, policy, and regulatory reform as well as industry and platform innovation.}

abstract = {With the increasing emphasis on sustainable development issues such as ensuring energy security, addressing climate change, and protecting the ecological environment, countries around the world have reached a general consensus to accelerate their energy transition (ET). In fact, China implemented a low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy in 2010 to explore green development and ET by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and improving environmental quality. Using panel data for 253 cities at the prefecture level, this paper creatively divides the dimensions of ET into energy consumption (EC), energy structure (ES), and energy intensity (EI) from the supply-side and demand-side perspectives and measures the local and spatial spillover effects of LCCP on ET by employing a difference-in-differences (DID) model and a spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model. The results indicate that LCCP accelerates ET, and the conclusions still hold after a series of robustness tests. Moreover, the results of the mechanism verification suggest that LCCP affects ET indirectly through total factor productivity (TFP), and its impact depends on the construction of public transportation (PT). Heterogeneity analysis of city location, size, and features reveals that LCCP is beneficial to ET in south cities, large cities, non-resource-based cities, and old industrial cities. We also find that LCCP generates positive spatial spillover effects on EC and EI and negative spatial spillover effects on ES in non-pilot cities.}

Second, in line with the need for the entire travel ecosystem to operate in ways that lead to more benefits and less negative impacts, every company should be seeking ways to streamline its operations toward minimizing negative impacts and maximizing benefits for itself and the entire ecosystem. Third, the industry as a whole has the opportunity to demonstrate reverse responsibility, that is, responsibility to society by using its powers to contribute to the alleviation of some more global societal challenges of our contemporary realities.}

By performing Monte Carlo simulations, this work evaluated the opportunity to use gradient descent, in combination with reliable mobile nodes as references, for the recalibration of wireless sensor networks in the context of smart cities. In the implemented simulations, sensor aging was treated as a deterministic process while encounters between sensors and mobile references occurred in a stochastic manner. Furthermore, by exchange of data during several encounters between sensors and mobile references, a recalibration data set was constructed. In addition, encounters were weighted according to their recency – more important when being more recent. The results presented here are promising, showing that even few recent encounters might be sufficient for recalibration in order to provide once again trustworthy measurement results.}

What mostly hinders their wide implementation is that their efficiency heavily depends on the local microclimatic specificities, since they cannot self-adjust to the environmental changes. This study aims at investigating benefits and impacts of smart logics applied to outdoor cooling, by field testing a web of nebulizers coupled to a bespoke fuzzy controller piloting the pump. The cooling action was tweaked as convenient to maintain comfortable conditions and to avoid energy wastage whenever unneeded. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of fuzzy logic to water spraying systems (or to any other controllable urban climate mitigation technology) targeting comfort and energy optimization. The prototype was field monitored in comparison with the conventional on-off control, in two Italian urban contexts (Cfa and Csa climatic zones) over 15 days in the hottest months of the year. The cooling and humidification action was thoroughly characterized by mapping both the horizontal and vertical profiles and by applying advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to spot the main environmental drivers. The maximum cooling (measured between the sprayed area and an undisturbed reference) touched 7.5 °C and 6.14 °C in the two locations, respectively. The energy saving achieved under fuzzy control versus the temporized control, was spectacularly high in the wetter and windier location with an average of −51.2% and a maximum of −67.5%. The comfort benefit was also substantial: the temperature never deviated from neutrality by more than ±2 °C, whereas with the on–off, this threshold was surpassed between the 14% and the 20% of the time by even more than 5 °C. The results suggest that smartly controlled nebulization is an energy-efficient and comfort-effective strategy to counteract urban overheating. Furthermore, solar-powered solutions are well suited as proved by the preliminary design estimation we included.}

In 2050, the forecast population of elderly people in India is about 300 million. The traditional kind of joint family in Indian culture has come under pressure due to family planning awareness, migration to cities, a lack of sustainability, and inadequate guidance from the elders. A virtual vision system (VVS) is a home-based monitoring device that captures the scene continuously to aid the user. The system helps the individual to navigate in a closed environment. The user can provide the system with commands, queries, and/or demands using free form natural language input to receive help. A wearable sensor that can track physiological parameters such as oxygen saturation, temperature, and pulse rate also can be integrated into the system. The risk of falling and potential injury is one reason for the elderly being placed in care facilities. The system also supports users by tracking their mobility, and helps to identify falls. The system autonomously patrols the user's environment without any user activity and checks if the user is well and has not suffered a fall. The VVS emphasis is on an application platform that incorporates distinct technical solutions such as biometric tools, remote doctor visits, emergency call and tracking systems, drug dispensers, and online shopping. In elderly care, continuous monitoring helps not only to focus on improving the senior's safety when a caregiver is not present, but also provides peace of mind to adult children who may be concerned about the welfare of their loved one. Such systems would be helpful for those in self-quarantine/isolation during this COVID-19 pandemic situation.}

Practical implementation of SG systems is the most effective way to reach these goals. In this paper, current smart grid statuses in some advanced countries are briefly reviewed. The implementation plans for smart grids in Taiwan are analyzed from the perspectives of strategic policy and cost-benefit. Then, gaps between supply and demand for new energy systems, opportunities for new industries, and suggestions for SG industries are discussed. Finally, recommendations for constructing an efficient and environmentally friendly SG in Taiwan for a low carbon society and sustainable development are provided.}

Recently, focus has only been on the latency and criticality based priority-aware policies for same channel bandwidth. Traffic scheduling and subsequent channel allocation are required to support both the differential throughput and latency requirements simultaneously for channels having different bandwidths and SNRs. In this paper, a QoS-aware framework for data traffic scheduling in cognitive radio based SG communication network is proposed. The channels available to smart grid Communication Nodes (SCNs) are categorized as low and high bandwidths. For each bandwidth, all SG applications are categorized into several priority-classes comprised of latency and throughput sub-classes. For both channel bandwidths, the scheduler maintains and updates two sets of priority queues based on weights associated with each class and its data type. The complete scheduling framework is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The overall objective function is the weighted sum of individual utility functions of latency and throughput. A novel usage of Adam optimizer is proposed to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput by obtaining optimal system cost, resulting in optimal decision policy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves desired QoS requirements in the presence of heavy PU traffic, whereas in case of no priority assignment, QoS requirements of lower priority applications are met by compromising the QoS of higher priority data.}

With the availability of mobile smart devices, many adolescents have developed the habit of being online and connected with other users almost all the time.
Objective
The aim of this paper is to provide a definition of being permanently online (PO) and permanently connected (PC) and to explore students’ current PO/PC behaviors.
Methods
An online survey was conducted with 178 university students in Germany to explore the intensity of their PO/PC behaviors in various social situations, the differences in being PO and being PC, students’ feelings about a possible loss of Internet access, and their online responding behaviors. We also shed some light on the associations between being PO/PC and various aspects of well-being, as well as between PO/PC and demographics and lifestyle.
Results
Smart device usage behaviors at night and behaviors in various social situations during the day indicate that PO and PC behaviors are occurring frequently. The results show that being connected to others (PC) seems to be more relevant to the participants than browsing the web (PO). Moreover, the participants expressed strong emotional responses about a temporary loss of Internet access. Coping behaviors in response to increasing number of incoming messages and permanent availability are reported.
Conclusion
This exploratory study demonstrates the relevance of the concepts of being PO and PC to students, and points out further research gaps.}

The prevalence of urban sprawl, amplified levels of auto dependency, and nonwork travel during the afternoon peak hours have resulted in a steady increase in unsustainable patterns of travel in Canadian cities. Active and green modes of transportation along with smart growth have been promoted as a panacea. This article investigates the efficacy of such sustainable urban mobility strategies in Windsor, Ontario, using data records from a Household Travel Survey. Multinomial and mixed-logit models are developed to identify the factors influencing nonwork mode choice travel behavior. Next, the models are used in a scenario-building and simulation exercise to illustrate the benefits attained from jointly improving public transit, encouraging smart growth development, and lowering vehicle ownership. Based on the obtained results, embracing single-policy instruments is not an effective approach for reducing auto dependency in the study area. However, adopting a multidimensional policy approach that integrates land use and transportation policy instruments is proven more effective for achieving sustainable outcomes. It is recommended that the service and facilities for transit and nonmotorized modes be improved, and easier access to commercial and recreational activities be enhanced through progressive improvements to the built environment. Adoption of smart-growth strategies should be also pursued by planners and decision makers to create an environment conducive to reducing the levels of auto ownership. Such a goal is of paramount importance for sustainability because the level of auto ownership emerged as the most important policy instrument for reducing auto dependency in the study area.}

The method is applied to the island of Gran Canaria (Spain), considering the entire energy system of the island. Several smart renewable energy strategies are proposed following a cross-sectoral approach between the electricity, heating/cooling, desalination, transport and gas sectors. The different smart renewable energy strategies were applied in a series of steps, while looking for a transition from the current energy system to a nearly 100% renewable energy system. Based on the results, the study concludes that the suggested method is applicable for increasing renewable integration on islands and can potentially be used in helping energy planners to take decisions about priorities in development of the sector to improve such integration. The results indicate that, for the case of Gran Canaria, a 75.9% renewable energy system could be attained with technologies that can be implemented at present. Furthermore, it is shown that a nearly 100% renewable energy system in Gran Canaria is technically feasible and could be achieved if certain technologies acquire greater maturity.}

abstract = {Since the 1990s, many cities have followed a global trend to become “sustainable” through urban policy. Yet little scholarly attention is given to the long-term processes by which cities incrementally develop their local notions of urban sustainability policy (USP) and how these change over time and across diverse initiatives and stakeholders. Our study fills that gap by combining the frameworks of performativity and co-production to analyze the “glocal” formation of USP in Tel Aviv over two decades. We relate this process to strategic planning and trace its evolution from the preparation of the city's first strategic plan in 2000, which introduced sustainability as a vague concept; through the actions of municipal “middle-out” agents, who leveraged performative opportunities to co-produce shared understandings of sustainability and implement programs for sustainable neighborhoods and urban nature; leading to a revised strategic plan with sustainability as its cornerstone, reframed through global urban networks such as C40 Cities. Based on interviews and analysis of interrelated case studies, we provide a fine-grained picture of Tel Aviv's USP formation and outline a conceptual model of “performative co-production” that could be applied to other cities worldwide to specify and evaluate how they create their variants of USP.}

Some implemented strategies may only be capable of dealing with a cluster of problems while leaving many others untouched. The co-benefits approach, however, opens up a ‘window of opportunity’ via achieving multi-goals simultaneously. Based on this, this paper aims to unpack the interrelationship between the struggling urban heat island (UHI) issue and the already ongoing sponge city (SPC) projects in China. Specifically, the co-benefits are investigated from technical, financial, institutional and social perspectives, after which pathways to implementation are presented. In these aspects, the co-benefits approach can bring opportunities for implementing SPC and UHI mitigation. The inclusion of UHI mitigation into SPC construction can enhance public participation and thereby consolidate the public-private partnership model for funds. During the co-benefits approach implementation, the weights of different authorities can be rebalanced to promote institutional transitions. SPC-derived UHI mitigation approach, potentially realising synergies of urban flooding and UHI mitigation, can be a model for countries which have already released low-impact development water management practices, and may also provide references for other projects such as green building, low-carbon eco-city, smart city, forest city and haze treatment for UHI mitigation.}

Apart from the significant role of TC windows in thermal energy conservation in buildings, they affect the indoor daylight performance due to their lower visible transmittance rate and tinted appearance. In this paper, we carried out a comprehensive study on the impact of TiO2@W-VO2 thermochromic glazing, fabricated by the authors, on indoor daylighting performance of a typical office room. The spectrophotometry test on the fabricated TC glass shows a significant modulation ability in near-infrared wavelengths. Based on the measured optical transmittance, daylight behaviors of the glazing were elaborated in terms of visual comfort, color quality of the transmitted light, non-visual daylight availability, and artificial lighting load, using computer simulation methods and numerical calculations. Finally, the paper offers an interactive approach between material development and fabrication methods on one hand, and holistic thermal and daylight analysis of the product on the other hand. This approach optimizes the physical properties of a TC glazing in tradeoff between solar modulation ability, visible transmittance, and color appearance.}

The member cities within the Intercultural City Network have developed several policy programme activities to create open and inclusive cities. These programmes present diversity as a challenge that needs to be managed and, at the same time, as an advantage that would increase economic growth. The concrete actions and objectives of these policy programmes include managing and creating public spaces that facilitate peaceful encounters, inclusion, and convivencia. Since policies are usually designed to address problems, it is important to investigate what the problems are perceived to be. Accordingly, by adopting Carol Bacchi's (2009) WPR (What is the Problem Represented to Be?) approach in policy analysis as an analytical framework, through semi-structured interviews and content analysis, this article illuminates how public spaces are conceived and represented in the Barcelona ICC program in relation to solving its inherent problematisations. The findings suggest that the ICC program conceives public spaces as settings of conflict that have to be managed through intercultural policy interventions, neglecting the complexity and multi-actor characteristic of the social construction and production of space.}

Without substantial advances in ICT our buildings will continue to be inefficient and perform poorly. Today most ICT related technology is called ‘Smart’. Unfortunately, most of the current technology in most of our current buildings is not Smart in terms of what is required to achieve energy efficient buildings. Consequently, innovative ICT is necessary to deliver the significant breakthroughs required for better control and operation of buildings. Without this capability all other innovative technology under development will be rendered ineffective. ICT is the key to Smart Buildings which can be aggregated into neighbourhoods, campuses, districts, cities and countries to provide a truly sustainable built environment.}

Although specific definitions may vary, CSA is typically conceived as having three pillars, namely Adaptation, Food Security and Mitigation. These three pillars as such, however, do not suffice for assessing scaling potentials of different CSA technologies as several other drivers may accelerate or impede large-scale adoption. This paper introduces a systematic approach for a comparative assessment of technology-specific scaling potentials distinguishing among three clusters of criteria. The ranking system requires scoring of CSA technologies by different stakeholder groups, namely farmers and extension workers/policy makers as well as research-based scoring. These scored values are then incorporated into a formula for calculating technology-specific ranking indices. This procedure also includes weighting factors to account for high and low significance of individual criteria for CSA scaling. The entire scoring procedure is illustrated through the case of a Climate-smart Village in Laos which is dominated by rainfed rice with low resource inputs. Improvements of rice varieties and seed systems clearly emerged as the most promising CSA intervention. Ideally, seeds used by farmers should (i) be a drought-tolerant rice variety and (ii) have better quality in terms of seed vigor and purity. Finally, the article discusses the applicability and versatility of this ranking system for other land use systems.}

A commercial building located in Montreal (Canada) with south-oriented integrated electrochromic windows is modeled. The hour-by-hour state of the smart windows required to minimize overall energy consumption while respecting constraints related to thermal and visual comfort is determined through an optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms (GA). Then, this quasi-optimal control is compared to other approaches that could be applied in real-time applications: (i) two types of rule-based controls (RBC), i.e. RBC1 and RBC2 and (ii) a model predictive control (MPC). The impacts of thermal mass and installed light power density are also analyzed. Results show that the four control strategies under study presented similar energy consumption with differences in total energy consumption ranging from 4% to 10%. While more complex controllers such as MPC could potentially lead to improved performances considering more design variables, complex models and extensive commissioning, this study illustrates that simpler control strategies such as RBC2 can also lead to satisfying results.}

This changes the traditional approach to transport tasks. If earlier the main topic was the forecasting of traffic flows, now the main thing is to highlight the patterns of using the transport system. It is pointless to predict what can be accurately measured. Accordingly, data on the movements of passengers become an indicator of the processes that take place in the city. In fact, transport data act as sensors, the measurements of which reflect the processes in the city system. For example, the distribution of entrances and exits of a particular metro station reflects the mode of use of the adjacent territory - a residential area, office centers, etc. In this paper, we consider the problem of assessing social clusters in a city based on information about the use of metro stations. Information on travel documents (in fact, in the form of payment for the trip) and the frequency of trips are used as the basis for such clustering.}

COVID-19 has brought challenges to the health of all mankind. It is particularly important to promote the construction of a ‘Healthy China’ and build a ‘healthy community’. The aims of this study were to construct a reasonable conceptual framework for the Healthy City concept and to assess Healthy City construction in China.
Study design
This study combined qualitative and quantitative research.
Methods
This study proposes the concept model of ‘nature–human body–Healthy City’ and accordingly constructs an evaluation index system for the construction of a Healthy City that integrates five dimensions, namely, the medical level, economic basis, cultural development, social services, and ecological environment to explore the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of Healthy City construction in China. Finally, the influencing factors of Healthy City construction patterns are explored using GeoDetector.
Results
(1) The pace of Healthy City construction is generally on the rise; (2) the construction of Healthy Cities exhibits significant global spatial autocorrelation and gradually increasing agglomeration. The spatial distribution of cold hotspot areas was relatively stable; (3) medical and health progress is an important factor; the level of economic development is the leading support; the endowment of resources and environment is the basic condition; public service support provides important support; and scientific and technological innovation capabilities provide technical support for the construction of a Healthy City.
Conclusions
The spatial heterogeneity of Healthy City construction in China is evident, and the state of spatial distribution is relatively stable. The spatial pattern of Healthy City construction is shaped by a combination of factors. Our research will provide a scientific basis for promoting the construction of Healthy Cities and helping to implement the Health China Strategy.}

When information collected from the physical space contains private or sensitive data that cannot be passed onto the cyber space, properly controlling the cyber-physical system becomes a very challenging task. For instance, the smart grid systems, a replacement for the traditional power grid systems, have been widely used in the industries. To prevent power shortage, threshold-based power usage control (PUC) in a smart grid considers a situation where the utility company sets a threshold to control the total power usage or supply of a neighborhood. If the total power usage exceeds the threshold, either certain households need to reduce their power consumption or the utility company needs to buy additional power supplies to meet the increasing demand. In these scenarios, the utility company needs to frequently collect power usage data from smart meters. It has been well documented that these power usage data can reveal a person's daily activity and violate personal privacy. To mitigate the privacy concerns, the goal of this paper is to develop efficient and privacy-preserving power usage control protocols that allow a utility company to balance supply and demand in a smart grid without violating personal privacy of its customers. We will provide extensive empirical study to show the practicality of our proposed protocols.}

Furthermore, the smoothing process of a large wind farm in which the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is used, needs a considerable initial investment cost. Utilizing Smart Parking Lots (SPLs) can be considered as an applicable solution. In this paper, assuming conventional parking lots in Tehran converted to an SPL set in a near future and thus establishing an enormous charging/discharging capacity, the smoothing process is performed on a 51 MW wind farm. For this purpose, a coordinated control system based on two control algorithms is proposed. The first proposed algorithm chooses eligible SPLs for charging/discharging activity before receiving a new sample of the wind farm output power. Afterwards, the second proposed algorithm determines qualified vehicles in selected SPLs. The main aim is to minimize the number of SPLs (vehicles) taking part in the process. According to the simulation results, the required BESS capacity in the power smoothing process of a typical wind farm decreases considerably when the proposed approach is applied. Thus, the investment cost of BESS is reduced significantly.}

Traditionally, networks have been studied in an independent fashion. With the emergence of novel smart city technologies, coupling among networks has been strengthened. To capture the ever-increasing coupling, we explain the notion of interdependent networks, i.e., multi-layered networks with shared decision-making entities, and shared sensing infrastructures with interdisciplinary applications. The main challenge is how to develop data analytics solutions that are capable of enabling interdependent decision making. One of the emerging solutions is agent-based distributed decision making among heterogeneous agents and entities when their decisions are affected by multiple networks. We first provide a big picture of real-world interdependent networks in the context of smart city infrastructures. We then provide an outline of potential challenges and solutions from a data science perspective. We discuss potential hindrances to ensure reliable communication among intelligent agents from different networks. We explore future research directions at the intersection of network science and data science.}

Every city is different and so are the supply options in given city locations. However, what is common in most cases is the lack of suitable logistics spaces in the city center and in the immediate vicinity. Traffic is also complicated by many parked cars, which sometimes make it impossible to even temporarily stop the vehicle, let alone handle the goods. Currently, there are several options for solving this group of problems. Ever-tightening emission requirements are pushing internal combustion cars out of city centers. As a result, carriers are being pushed into electromobility or other alternatives for supplying the so-called last mile. This term characterizes, for example, the microdepots network. These depots are most often located in abandoned parking lots and are operated by the given transport company. Prague participates financially in the operation of these depots.}

Further, this paper pays attention to the heterogeneous, direct, and indirect impacts of financial inclusion on carbon inequality. (1) The first finding is that financial inclusion achieves the dual dividends of narrowing carbon inequality within and between cities. (2) The mitigation effect of financial inclusion on carbon inequality is heterogeneous in terms of cities' administrative hierarchy, geographical location, and economic scale. (3) Six aspects of financial inclusion lead directly to the mitigation of carbon inequality. (4) The inhibitory effect of financial inclusion on carbon inequality is caused mainly by reduced intensity of carbon emissions and income inequality, which are two effective mediators. These findings help us devise solutions for eradicating carbon inequality by designing policies related to financial inclusion.}

This project is specifically designed to improve the safety of motorcycle riders. Motorcyclists will be alerted if their speed limits are crossed and vehicles that enter the vehicle nearby hit. The helmet system emerging message using cloud-based service will send message to receiving contents in which the database has been stored. There are many countries enforcing a regulations requiring that the motorcycle driver wears a helmet while riding on his motorcycle. Most accidents are caused by reckless driving, drunk or mobile phone use, while traffic laws and rules are violated. Many People lose their lives due to late notification of accident due to that the people are not able to monitor the accident area's precise GPS coordinates. The significant reason that people get injured in head due to not wearing helmet while driving the bike. For the tracking of the rider's head and the acceleration of motorcycle, a Force Sensing resistor (FSR) are used. The motorcycle engine will only be started when the driver buckled the helmet. A LED will flash in helmet while some obstacles or a critical risk. Thus this research helps the researches for implementing and adopting the helmets in various aspects of security and protection of humans in future studies.}

This is because of its small size, low power consumption and environmental resilience. This paper presents a vehicle detection algorithm based on a new type of AMR sensor called Smart Road Stud (SRS), which can detect the Magnetic Field Intensity (MFI) disturbance generated by passing vehicles. The proposed two-step process can extract the disturbance signal from MFI time series with a simple determination of threshold and a more widespread applicability. However, when vehicle temporal headway is short, an extracted signal may be generated by more than one vehicle. For this case, a method to recognize the number of vehicles the signal corresponds to is proposed also. The results show that the accuracy of traffic volume measurement is higher than 97% when detecting traffic volume in two adjacent lanes.}

An emerging field where social networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people. Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind these, and the potentialities.}

This article presents a perspective on how resilience could be quantitatively assessed through a set of indices. It starts with a brief explanation of resilience in the context of supply chain and a quick summary of existing quantitative measures of resilience. It then discusses how resilience could be quantified in a constructive manner so that the resulting metrics are representative of the performance throughout the system's life cycle. In particular, it is proposed that resilience should be evaluated according to different time periods, i.e. before, during and after a disruption has occurred. Four dimensions of resilience, namely reliability, robustness, recovery and reconfigurability, can then be used to make up a set of indices for resilience. For numerical illustration, these indices are computed based on recovery data arising from Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Finally, it is postulated that resilience will be the performance metric that complements productivity and sustainability as the third pillar for measuring success of organizations, and in turn, that of sovereign countries in their quests for developing smart cities.}

These events leads to damage to distribution grid equipments, and they are cause widespread blackouts. This paper presents short-term resilience enhancement of the residential sections against hurricane at day-ahead. The lines outage in the electrical distribution grid is implemented as stochastic modeling by hurricane. The resilience enhancement is done in the multiple energy systems such as integrated gas, heat and electrical. The three-stage multi-objective functions optimization is proposed for resilience-oriented enhancement. The proposed strategy for resilience-oriented enhancement including installation of the mobile generators (MGs), implementation of the demand side management (DSM) strategy and local generation (LG) in each stage. In first stage optimization, minimizing the installation costs of the MGs is modeled subject to lines outage. The DSM strategy is modeled in second stage optimization as minimization of the electrical demand deviation than optimal demand level at day-ahead. Then, minimization of the 1) operation cost and 2) loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index are considered in third stage optimization. In addition to, installation of the MGs and DSM in first and second stages; LG by electrical storage systems (ESSs) in third stage optimization is taken into accounted. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is confirmed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution grid as three case studies by numerical simulation. The obtained results for operation cost and LPSP index in first case are $1,098,833.4 and 0.11 kW, respectively. In second case, LPSP index is minimized by %52.2 than first case. Finally, operation cost and LPSP in third case and with participation of the ESS are reduced by %52.2 and %0.78 in comparison to second case, respectively.}

In the literature, several works contribute to the development of optimization methods to deal with DSM in residential sectors. Three common challenges are presented: (1) reducing the electricity payment, (2) reducing the peak-to-average ratio, and (3) maximizing the users’ comfort. A great number of publications carry out with the energy management in a smart house, which aimed at minimizing the electricity cost and maximizing the users’ comfort. However, those that integrate renewable energy sources (RESs) have not received much attention. To deal with this issue, this study presents a multiobjective optimization technique for residential DSM over a day. The main contributions of the present work are: first, a novel approach to control residential load, taking into consideration that maximization of the users’ comfort and minimization of the electricity cost, is established. Second, RESs and battery storage systems are introduced to reduce further the electricity payment and the discomfort. Third, a mixed-integer linear programming algorithm is used to optimally allocate the electrical power according to the objective function. Constraints, including daily energy requirements, user preferences and energy availability from solar panels and batteries are considered. Three scenarios are proposed: the first one adopts the main grid as the only existing source of energy. The second one combines the main grid and solar panels. And the last one is a combination of the main grid, solar panels, and energy storage system. The results obtained for the different scenarios reveal that the proposed method offers a maximum satisfaction of the user with a minimum cost and demonstrate an optimal use of solar panels and battery storage. Finally, the daily cost and waiting time are compared for the previously proposed scenarios.}

This study aimed to provide early warning information on desertification risk in the form of warning maps, using effective key indicators of land degradation in a 15-year period in the arid regions of northeastern Iran. E-SMART key Indicators should be E: Economic, S: Specific, M: Measurable, A: Achievable, R: Relevant, and T: Time-bound. Multiple regression analysis showed that the majority of indicators could accurately assess desertification risk at a 99% confidence level with R2 = 0.81. Furthermore, compared to the beginning of the study period, areas under desertification warning due to natural and anthropogenic factors had increased by about 78 percent in 2015. This observation is aligned with the impacts of drought, which has resulted from the continued reduction in rainfall. The expansion of at-risk areas has in turn exacerbated the adverse environmental conditions and amplified the effects of drought in the area. Spatio-temporal changes in soil salinity, groundwater quality, groundwater level, vegetation, agricultural development, and socioeconomic issues showed that the study area has suffered from land degradation and desertification between 2000 and 2015.}

This study analyzes and compares the hourly DH load patterns for a city and five different types of buildings over an entire year. The various operating modes introduce nonlinear dependencies between the DH load and the outdoor temperature. We compare the prediction accuracies of different multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Without nonlinear dependencies, both ANN and MLR provide good, almost identical prediction accuracies. In the case of nonlinear dependencies, ANN is superior to MLR. However, the novel clustering method eliminates nonlinear dependencies and improves the accuracy of MLR on par with the ANN. ANN methods can automatically adapt to various nonlinearities. The advantage of combining MLR with the clustering method is that it is simpler than designing an ANN method, although manual work is required. In addition, MLR methods provide more insight into load patterns and how the load depends on various factors compared with ‘black-box’ ANN models. The developed methodology can be widely applied to building- and city-level load analyses and forecasting in different DH systems combined with or without domestic hot water consumption.}

One way of keeping honey bees healthy is to be able to monitor and control the general conditions in a beehive and also outside of a beehive. Monitoring systems offer an effective way of accessing, visualizing, sharing, and managing data that is gathered from performed agricultural and livestock activities for domain stakeholders. Such systems have recently been implemented based on wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT to monitor the activities of honey bees in beehives as well. Scholars have shown considerable interests in proposing IoT- and WSN-based beehive monitoring systems, but much of the research up to now lacks in proposing appropriate architecture for open data driven beehive monitoring systems. Developing a robust monitoring system based on a contemporary software architecture such as microservices can be of great help to be able to control the activities of honey bees and more importantly to be able to keep them healthy in beehives. This research sets out to design and implementation of a sustainable WSN-based beehive monitoring platform using a microservice architecture. We pointed out that by adopting microservices one can deal with long-standing problems with heterogeneity, interoperability, scalability, agility, reliability, maintainability issues, and in turn achieve sustainable WSN-based beehive monitoring systems.}

However, this disparity has not been adequately addressed, impeding strategic PEVC development planning. To clarify these disparities, this study combines an analysis of the supply-demand and usage costs of PEVCs, which are the main factors affecting vehicle electrification, and evaluates the disparities in PEVC service among 35 cities of varying levels in Chengdu–Chongqing Urban Agglomeration. The results indicate that mega-cities demonstrate the highest service levels, attributed to their robust supply capacity and well-developed pricing mechanisms, but they also face higher actual demand pressures. Medium-sized and small cities show intermediate PEVC service, while large cities unexpectedly demonstrate the lowest supply-demand level and highest usage costs due to the mismatch between PEVC supply and demand size. Additionally, the study highlights the priority of PEVC station scale in enhancing the supply. These findings inform policymakers in shaping targeted strategies and policies, adapting to the varying PEVC service levels across different cities.}

The model is implemented in the distribution system that considers all relevant grid constraints. The case study is conducted in an archipelago characterised by a medium-voltage distribution system connected to the mainland grid. The obtained results showed that the implementation of the proposed demand response model caused a 0.13 kV voltage deviation which did not cause voltage issues for the observed distribution system. The breakpoint incentive was achieved for an incentive value of 23% of the day-ahead market, and the demand response was not activated for higher values than the breakpoint incentive. The highest savings amounted to 258.7 € for the scenario with the highest flexibility allowed. The results implicate that implementing the demand response model in the grid would benefit all observed stakeholders in the system.}

In this connection, effective land administration is a significant element to actualize sustainable development. Yet existing building permit procedures fail to satisfy the need for current construction demands because of the insufficient transparency and inefficient procedures. Two dimensional (2D) based systems also remain incapable to unambiguously delineate the property ownership related to complex buildings. Keeping up-to-date the three dimensional (3D) urban models is another key for smart cities but this issue has become difficult owing to the rapid changes in the cities. In this sense, this paper first examines thoroughly the current situation in Turkey in terms of the building permit procedures, land administration, and 3D city modeling. Then, the paper detailedly proposes a reformative framework. The framework consists of the use of digital building models for both building permit processes and 3D registration of property ownership, as well as updating the 3D city model databases. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of its applicability with a discussion of the prospective directions.}

We establish a dataset that includes factors, e.g., housing structures, visual quality, and human physical perception. Then, we use machine learning models to extract features from multisource data, investigate the price appreciation of 1,032 houses in Wuhan from 2015 to 2020 and use multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to discuss spatial dependence. Finally, we perform a cluster analysis to understand the combined effects. The results show that human physical perception has the highest effect, the visual quality of urban streets has the highest impact in places where highly educated people gather, and the impact of service facilities is greatest in economically underdeveloped areas.

abstract = {Smart Grid (SG) is an evolution of conventional electricity grid, answering to the problems like electricity shortages, escalation in electricity prices, power quality issues and need for using environment friendly green energy resources. Key to attain this is design and deployment of a Smart Grid Communication Network (SGCN) that is not only reliable and secure but also fulfills the communication requirements. The purpose of this research article is to provide a detailed survey on SGCN in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies and applications. Using a multi-layer approach of dividing the communication layer in to Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN), this paper first discusses the communication requirements, followed by an overview of SG applications. Then a detailed comparison is given for current wired and wireless communication technologies along with new standards/technologies like Cognitive Radio (CR), Smart Utility Networks (SUNs) and TV White Spaces (TVWS) that are ideal for SG environment, followed by proposed CR based network architecture for SGCN and its salient features. The paper is then concluded by contributing some open issues, challenges and future directions.}

In this paper, we investigate intrusion detection on connected and autonomous vehicles using supervised machine learning techniques. The overarching goal is to develop a taxonomy for linked intrusion detection systems and supervised learning algorithms. To that end, we provide a thorough explanation of the concepts of intrusion detection systems and cyber-security attacks. Then, we demonstrate how machine learning can improve the security of future connected and autonomous vehicles by examining and evaluating how to protect sent and transferred data. Finally, a taxonomy based on these related works is offered. Based on a review of four well-known data sets in this field, we can conclude from this taxonomy that the classification performance of supervised learning algorithms is strong and encouraging.}

abstract = {Previous studies have provided valuable insights into the impact of green space (GS) on land surface temperature (LST). However, there is a need for in-depth comparative research on changing landscape patterns in cities and their effects on the urban thermal environment. This study investigates the spatial arrangement of GS and the influence of impervious surfaces on LST in urban areas, examining their cooling and warming effects in the urban landscapes of Beijing and Islamabad. The study aims to assess the impact of the spatial arrangement of GS on LST using a moving window of 1 km2 to analyze the overall effect of landscape patterns on the urban environment. Using Gaofen (GF–2) and Landsat–8 satellite data, we examined the biophysical surface properties of core urban areas. The results indicate a significant difference in the mean LST of 5.44 °C and 3.31 °C between impervious surfaces and GS in Beijing and Islamabad, respectively. The barren land and GS in Islamabad experience a higher LST of 3.39 °C compared to Beijing, which accounts for 1.39 °C. In Beijing, configuration metrics show no significant effect on urban LST, while edge density (ED) exhibits a slightly negative trend. In contrast, in the city of Islamabad, the landscape shape index (LSI), patch density (PD), and number of patches (NP) metrics have a significant influence on LST. The cooling effect of GS patches (0.1–0.5 ha) is more pronounced, while that of GS patches of 15–20 ha shows no significant effect on LST. The temperature difference (TD) of 5.01 °C was observed from the edge of GS in Beijing and 3.3 °C in Islamabad. Considering Islamabad's lush green scape compared to Beijing, this study suggests that Islamabad may experience an increase in LST in the future due to urbanization. This study's findings may assist urban policy-makers in designing sustainable green city layouts that effectively address future planning considerations.}

abstract = {Background
Poor adherence to treatment is common in hemodialysis patients. However, effective interventions for adherence in this population are lacking. Small studies of behavioral interventions have yielded improvements, but clinical effectiveness and long-term effects are unclear.
Study Design
Multicenter parallel (1:1) design, blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial.
Setting & Participants
Patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis enrolled in 14 dialysis centers.
Intervention
Dialysis shifts of eligible patients were randomly assigned to either an interactive and targeted self-management training program (HED-SMART; intervention; n=134) or usual care (control; n=101). HED-SMART, developed using the principles of problem solving and social learning theory, was delivered in a group format by health care professionals over 4 sessions.
Outcomes & Measurements
Serum potassium and phosphate concentrations, interdialytic weight gains (IDWGs), self-reported adherence, and self-management skills at 1 week, 3 months, and 9 months postintervention.
Results
235 participants were enrolled in the study (response rate, 44.2%), and 82.1% completed the protocol. IDWG was significantly lowered across all 3 assessments relative to baseline (P<0.001) among patients randomly assigned to HED-SMART. In contrast, IDWG in controls showed no change except at 3 months, when it worsened significantly. Improvements in mineral markers were noted in the HED-SMART arm at 3 months (P<0.001) and in potassium concentrations (P<0.001) at 9 months. Phosphate concentrations improved in HED-SMART at 3 months (P=0.03), but these effects were not maintained at 9 months postintervention. Significant differences between the arms were found for the secondary outcomes of self-reported adherence, self-management skills, and self-efficacy at all time points.
Limitations
Low proportion of patients with diabetes.
Conclusions
HED-SMART provides an effective and practical model for improving health in hemodialysis patients. The observed improvements in clinical markers and self-report adherence, if maintained at the longer follow-up, could significantly reduce end-stage renal disease−related complications. Given the feasibility of this kind of program, it has strong potential for supplementing usual care.

In order to enable the joint operation, the concept of Smart Building Cluster (SBC) is introduced in this paper. An energy management framework for achieving optimal operations of SBC is proposed, and the information exchange processes between the Smart Building Cluster Operator (SBCO) and the participating SBs are described. A multi-party energy management model for SBC based on non-cooperative game theory is proposed, considering building-integrated PV systems and automatic demand response (ADR), with all participating SBs viewed as players in the game. The existence of Nash equilibrium in the game model is proved, and the process for solving the Nash equilibrium strategy is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Furthermore, the solution method and procedure based on an iterative method are proposed. Finally, via a practical example, the effectiveness of the model is verified. The proposed method is able to reduce the total cost of the SBs by 4.6% and improve the load factor of the SBC from 0.68 to 0.76 when the proportion of shiftable loads is 25% in the total load profile.}

New internal brokers are those under the control of the platform, while legacy external brokers are those in place managed by third parties. The solution proposed addressed problems of (a) interoperability to reduce set up time to cope with unknown data structures (devices, entities) distributed via brokers; (b) performance by dimensioning both front-end and back-end processes to reach high rates in a broker-based platform, while preserving full capability features of the data warehouse. Interoperability aspects have been addressed by introducing our concepts and a reasoner into an IoT Directory tool to manage Internal and External brokers, automate device discovery and registration from both standard and customized data models. Despite the managed complexity, a broker-based solution turned out to provide high performance. To this end, a specific assessment and architecture tuning have been performed and reported in the paper to give evidence and validation. The proposed integrated IoT Directory has been developed in the context of the Herit-Data Project, and it is currently used in the whole Snap4City network of 18 tenants and billions of data.

Nevertheless, today’s smart mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wristbands are still onerous to automatically establish mobile ad hoc connections with our physical circle of friends and between occasional contact opportunities. Motivated by this, this study presents Cocoon as a lightweight middleware proposed for smart mobile platforms to support mobile opportunistic communications for general public use. Cocoon employs an adaptive context-aware service that can fairly coordinate a multitude of concurrently-running networking applications. Along with this service, the opportunistic networking service of Cocoon facilitates fast and reliable information sharing between participating devices according to our real-world applicability and validation experiments presented in this work. The routing protocols of Cocoon are designed above the universally-accepted Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards. Without requiring any configuration or modification on top of the affiliated wireless interfaces, Cocoon is therefore suitable for direct use on any kind of smart mobile platform.}

The followed process builds on data transparency and stakeholder communication, and enables decision making through aggregation of the analysis results. Evalog, an open platform, has been developed based on the framework concepts and is implemented to assess and cross-compare city logistics solutions that have been selected by twelve European city cases. The output of Evalog is the integration of all indicators in the Logistics Sustainability Index (LSI), which depicts the solution’s impact per stakeholder category and the Global LSI (GLSI), which represents the overall impact at city level. Results showed that an average improvement of 24.5% may be achieved in all criteria and city cases owing to the logistics solution.}

abstract = {The Royal Society recently highlighted the huge energy storage needs for the United Kingdom to make stable a grid only fed by solar and wind energy, which must come mostly from hydrogen energy storage. Similar results are obtained for NEOM City modeling the operation of a 50/50 wind and solar energy production, adopting an efficiency for green hydrogen production of 0.75, and an efficiency for power generation from the hydrogen of 0.55. The analysis for NEOM City suggests that with an evenly distributed combined wind and solar generating capacity of 30 GW, a dispatchable annual energy contribution of 60 TWh to the grid is attainable. This presupposes the availability of hydrogen energy storage amounting to no less than 8 TWh and electrolyzers with a power capacity of 22 GW. Ideally, the hydrogen power generation facility should have a nominal power of 13.5 GW. Integrating an intermediate high-efficiency energy storage system, such as flow batteries, between wind and solar generators and electrolyzers can significantly cut the power of the electrolyzers by up to 80 %. A high-efficiency combined cycle gas turbine power plant is then proposed to feed back the grid burning a mixture of green hydrogen and natural gas. By using an almost off-the-shelf technology, gradually shifting towards higher hydrogen contents as green hydrogen becomes more readily available, this solution delivers the lowest possible life cycle CO2 emission at any time during the progress of the project.}

A frame analysis of 67 documents published in the Barcelona City Council website during 2015–2018 has been used. Additionally, documents about strategies, plans and public policies related with Barcelona Sharing City were taken into account. Municipality's initiatives in relation to the sharing city spread across eleven areas including education, housing, entrepreneurship among others. Using the prognostic, diagnostic and motivational framings, it is found that the municipality aims i) to promote the sharing city as the combination of a top-down approach and citizen participation, ii) to constitute the notion of sharing as an opportunity for the city's future iii) to generate trust towards the local administration presenting it as an agent for the city's change. Also, the notion of sharing and sharing economy are explored in the case of Barcelona sharing city.}

One strand of research in this field has investigated the effects on household energy consumption of the feed-back provided by smart meters. However, another aspect that deserves attention is the motivation for households to use the feed-back to save energy. This paper explores how the emerging trend of using complementary currencies for sustainability policies could translate into new interventions adapted to the smart meter deployment and capable of promoting more autonomous forms of motivation compared to interventions using official currencies. Three systems designs (rewarding, regulatory and hybrid) are presented and discussed within the framework of self-determination theory. Because the rewarding system S1 can contribute positively people's basic needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, it could lead to more autonomous forms of motivation. The conclusions regarding the regulatory system S2 are less clear, although the hybrid variant S3 that integrates mechanisms from the rewarding system into the regulatory system could be perceived as more consonant with people's basic need for autonomy.}

abstract = {High-quality temperature data at a finer spatio-temporal scale is critical for analyzing the risk of heat exposure and hazards in urban environments. The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 °C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 °C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am – 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 °C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 °C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers.}

However, The PV power output decreases due to the change of solar radiation and the influence of shadow. Therefore, the authors have analyzed the optimal install parameters such as direction and tilt angle of PV panels considering the influence of shadow. The authors have aimed at optimizing operation of PV generation for building smart grids in Japan.}
