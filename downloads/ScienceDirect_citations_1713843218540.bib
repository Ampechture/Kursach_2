abstract = {The recent trend towards IPv6 (Internet protocol version 6) has gained a great deal of interest with regard to smart cities due to its increased address space. A vital issue in designing a router is to establish the output port of an incoming IP packet along with its destination. Thus, the IP lookup architecture must achieve high speeds, supporting IPv6 with quick real-time updates to serve perpetually developing routing tables. The problem with IP lookup is that of achieving a throughput of more than 100 gigabits per second. In addition, it is difficult to store all the IP lookups in the on-chip memory devices. This paper proposes a new pipeline design called the linear pipelined IPv6 lookup architecture that overcomes the shortcomings of the POLP (parallel optimized linear pipeline) and BPFL (balanced parallelized frugal lookup) algorithms. The new B-tree algorithm is based on the idea of specific prefixes along with robust routing tables. The linear pipelined IP lookup design has been implemented in Verilog HDL using an Altera Quartus Stratix II device. Three different sizes of lookup tables are utilized to assess the proposed method. The logic elements, SRAM, memory and maximum frequency results are better for the proposed method compared with the POLP and BPFL methods.}

Applying technologies such as information and communication technology, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and autonomous systems in cities' design, planning, and management can cause disruptive changes in their social, economic, and environmental composition. Through a systematic literature review, this research develops a conceptual model linking (1) the dominant city labels relating to tech-driven urban development, (2) the characteristics and applications of disruptive technologies, and (3) the current understanding of inclusive urban development. We extend the discussion by identifying and incorporating the motivations behind adopting disruptive technologies and the challenges they present to inclusive development. We find that inclusive development in tech-driven cities can be realised if governments develop suitable adaptive regulatory frameworks for involving technology companies, build policy capacity, and adopt more adaptive models of governance. We also stress the importance of acknowledging the influence of digital literacy and smart citizenship, and exploring other dimensions of inclusivity, for governing disruptive technologies in inclusive smart cities.}

abstract = {With the technological drive for realizing smart cities, work on Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) protocols opts to replace the traditional traffic light system by using cooperative Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in order to decrease road congestion and increase vehicular throughput. However, these protocols simply ignore pedestrians as road users and do not provision for safe pedestrian crossing. Basically, a road intersection not only could be traffic bottleneck, but also nearly 23% of the total automotive related fatalities and almost 1 million injury-causing crashes occur at or within intersections every year. This article opts to fill such a technical gap. We present a novel system that prioritizes pedestrians crossing and guarantees safety while preserving the efficiency of AIM based approaches. Our system does not require additional infrastructure or pedestrian-carried devices, and works for both self-driving and human-derived vehicles. The simulation results show that our proposed system for Autonomous Pedestrian Crossing (APC) protocol of non-signalized intersections significantly decreases the vehicle’s delay and pedestrian walk duration compared to the conventional traffic light-based systems. The effectiveness of APC is validated for traffic scenarios with (1) self-driving vehicles, and (2) mix of human-based and self-driving vehicles.}

Thus, social media has become a very prominent data source to obtain data and contextual information. Recently, cities are exposed to a variety of challenges such as health care, environment, energy consumption, traffic congestion, housing, education, public safety, budgets, economic development, demographics, diversity, and inclusiveness. So, technological advances bear the promise of addressing many of these challenges. At this point, the feedback from the citizens and city inhabitants is needed to collaborate voluntarily with observations about their surrounding environment. Thus, the technology plays an important role to offer solutions essentially fostering the civic participation. This chapter is focused on examining this particular issue, taking into consideration data from social media that can assist governments and organizations to better understand various phenomena massively and nearly to real time. A framework for urban analysis based on civic participation is proposed, in which social media posts are used to explicitly describe geographic features and events as well as spatial relationships that include time stamps and geolocation data. On the other hand, to highlight the advantage of the framework, a geographic information system–approach is considered, emphasizing aspects related to the data quality, where the diversity of criteria applied by users in the data acquisition is presented. As a case study, Twitter was chosen as the social media for its common use in scientific and commercial data analysis.}

abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), the adoption of 5G, and progress towards 6G technology have led to the accumulation of massive amounts of real-world data; however, a significant portion of the data generated by smart cities and smart buildings remains unused. A notable problem is the shift of statistical properties in real-world streaming over time caused by unexpected factors, referred to as concept drift, which results in less efficient predictive models. To address this problem, the latest research leverages the cloud–edge continuum paradigm for the deployment of AI and general smart city applications while utilising the available resources optimally. In this article, we propose a computing architecture for different smart city applications in edge micro data centre (EMDC) settings over a hybrid cloud–edge continuum to support the deployment of AI workloads. We implement a feedback-driven automated concept drift detection and adaptation methodology, combining base learner long short-term memory (LSTM) with Page–Hinkley test (PHT), adaptive windowing (ADWIN) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov windowing (KSWIN). Real-world data streams are utilised to forecast from various environmental sensors installed at the University of Oulu Smart Campus. The feedback-based concept drift detection and adaption process is first evaluated using synthetic datasets with known concept drift points and then employed in the real-world data. Subsequently, the implementation is evaluated using the state-of-the-art MAE, RMSE, and MAPE methods. The results showed a reduction in MAPE from 8.5% to 3.88% when concept drift detection was applied. Additionally, the challenges faced and the effectiveness of the suggested solutions are explored.}

It comes, among other things, with noteworthy air pollution, time and energy wastage, and drivers’ discomfort due to parking spots scarcity. Finding a parking spot has become a major problem for drivers. To overcome this problem, smart parking services that detect parking spot occupancy status and inform drivers about their availability have been proposed. The deployment of these solutions is reducing the costs associated to traffic jams or gas consumption. However, one of the main challenges faced when planning and deploying this kind of service is the communication technology used by the parking sensors, which are typically buried under the asphalt, as it has to cover large areas of the city in the most cost-effective way. In this paper, we analyze the behavior and performance of a LoRaWAN network supporting the smart parking service in the city of Santander. The sensors and network deployment are described and the thorough experimental evaluation of the network behavior is presented. The goal of this assessment is to provide insights that could be helpful for better understanding the key factors affecting the communication. The long-termed analysis of the parking sensors deployments studied, have allowed us to derive an experimental propagation model that could be useful for the planning of city-scale IoT infrastructures employing LoRaWAN networks as their wireless access technology. Moreover, we have also analyzed the behavior of the LoRa wireless network in order to evaluate the possibility of leveraging network information to increase the confidence on smart parking sensor readings through AI-based predictors.}

Effective methods for traffic congestion prediction can help people make travel plans reasonably with Advanced Traveler Information Systems. Most of the existing methods for traffic congestion prediction was designed for a specific location. The parameters need to be modified when applying these methods to different locations. Other studies on the traffic network require sophisticated data pre-processing such as map matching. In this paper, we build a model named Relative Position Congestion Tensor and propose a Predictor for Position Congestion Tensor for traffic congestion prediction. First, we design a novel approach to construct congestion matrix on region traffic networks using the concept of relative locations for road nodes and convert matrices into three-dimensional spatio-temporal tensors. Then, we propose a method based on convolutional long-short term memory network to predict congestion at all locations of the road network in the near future. The experiments show that in all locations where congestion often occurs, the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models including Linear Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regression, Long-Short Term Memory and generally outperforms the Convolution-based deep Neural Network modeling Periodic traffic data. Furthermore, we study the internal structure of the Predictor for Position Congestion Tensor model to analyze the interpretability of the model for congestion prediction. The results show that the proposed model can accurately capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic.}

Singapore’s urban built environment has become more complex with increased multilevel land use below and above the ground. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) maps are, therefore, increasingly inadequate to support effective management of the city. To address the issue, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) leads a whole-of-government (WHOG) initiative to create and maintain a geometrically accurate three-dimensional (3D) national topographic map and high-quality 3D datasets that capture fundamental as-built 3D information of buildings, terrain, and roads. These datasets serve as the authoritative base map which can be shared across government agencies to satisfy the increasing needs of government and agencies in smart operation, development planning, policymaking, and risk management. This chapter introduces the technological innovations that have been adopted to make changes in multiagency collaboration, as well as making a difference in the city experience of Singapore for social innovation. As a case study, the chapter explores the drivers, actors, and innovative aspects of developing a web-based geospatial platform integrating different 2D and 3D data and models. The platform integrates an intelligent environment decision support system (IEDSS) and a quantitative urban environment simulation tool (QUEST) to facilitate citizen-based and multiagency collaboration in urban planning, design, and resource allocation.}

With the development of smart cities, there needs to be a better understanding of how the introduction of smart technologies will affect urban resilience. To address this issue, this article presents a critical review of the literature on smart cities and smart technologies focussing on representations of resilience. The findings reveal that discussing resilience in relation to smart city components of the data layer, digital technologies and the physical city can provide some degree of clarity despite the existence of a multiplicity of definitions and interpretations. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the nature of relationships between ‘smartness’ and ‘resilience’ remains contested, and largely dependent on the perceived role of digital technologies in resilience-building processes. This in turn is influenced by how these technologies are used and what the intention and expectations are in relation to their use. In order to address these issues, we conclude that further interdisciplinary research, extending to the physical, social and environmental systems of cities, is needed to better understand the relations between smartness and resilience.}

An intelligent transportation system introduces smart technology to civil transportation infrastructure, and the connected car further creates the opportunity for vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. We identify threats and attacks enabled by smart transportation and intelligent transportation systems, and survey methods for providing security and privacy.}

To help support and facilitate winter maintenance decisions, an advanced ITS monitoring technology known as the road weather information systems (RWIS), available in both stationary and mobile forms, has been deployed throughout many road networks around the world. RWIS autonomously provides real-time and near-future road weather and surface conditions information which highway maintenance authorities use to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their maintenance-related decisions. However, deployment is limited due to its high installation and perpetual operating costs. To overcome these limitations, transportation agencies use a variety of methods to estimate the weather/road surface conditions based on the limited RWIS data points or measured locations to maximize the return on their investments. In this chapter, two different types of RWIS are introduced, including a discussion of their advantages and limitations. More importantly, the state-of-the-art parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating weather/road surface conditions, using the two types of RWIS, are also presented via real-world case studies. Results presented herein provide a stepping-stone toward the creation of a winter weather resilient smart city, which in the long run will benefit people in cold regions with improved safety and a more sustainable winter transportation system and environment.}

abstract = {The expected increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the coming years will contribute to reducing CO2 pollution in our cities. Currently, EVs' users may suffer from distress due to long charging service times and overloaded charging stations (CSs). Critical traffic conditions (e.g., traffic jams) affect EVs' trip time (TT) towards CSs and thus influence the total trip duration. With this concern, Intelligent transport systems (ITS) and more specifically connected vehicle technologies, can leverage an efficient real-time EV charging service by jointly considering CSs status and traffic conditions in the city. In this work, we propose a scheme to manage EVs' charging planning, focusing on the selection of a CS for the energy-requiring EV. The proposed scheme considers anticipated charging slots reservations performed through a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which has been regarded as a cost-efficient communication framework. In specific, we consider two aspects: 1) the EV's total trip time towards its destination considering an intermediate charging at each candidate CS, and 2) the communication delay of the VANET routing protocol. First, in order to estimate the EV's total trip time, our CS selection scheme takes into account the average road speed, traffic lights, and route distance, along the path of the EV. The optimal CS that produces the minimum total charging service time (including the TT) is suggested to that energy-requiring EV. Then, we introduce two communication modes based on geographical routing protocols for VANETs to attain an anticipated charging slot reservation. Simulation results show that with our charging scheme EVs' charging service time is reduced and more EVs are successfully charged.}

The future 5G network aims to build the infrastructure from mobile internet to connected world. Small Cell is one of the most promising technologies of 5G to provide more connections and high data rate. In order to make the best use of small cell technology, smart cell planning should be implemented to guarantee connectivity and performance for all end nodes. It is particularly a challenging task to deploy dense small cells in the presence of dynamic traffic demands and severe co-channel interference. In this paper, we model various traffic patterns using stochastic geometry approach and propose an energy-efficient scheme to deploy and plan small cells according to the prevailing traffic pattern. The simulation results indicate that our scheme can meet dynamic traffic demands with optimized deployment of small cells and enhance the energy efficiency of the system without compromising on quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In addition, our scheme can achieve very close performance compared with the leading optimization solver CPLEX and find solutions in much less computational times than CPLEX.}

abstract = {Electronic ticketing in public transportation based on smart cards is gaining momentum worldwide. It is widely recognized that a smart card system can deliver benefits to both passengers and operators, but due to its complexity, implementation can come at a considerable cost. Therefore, it is likely that a commercial appraisal from the perspective of the public transportation operator alone would reveal that costs are higher than benefits and, hence, economic non-viability. This paper presents the experiences of the Norwegian city of Trondheim, which recently implemented a fully-interoperable electronic smart card system. A social cost-benefit analysis of the scheme is presented, focusing on net overall benefits for the passengers, the bus company, the local transportation authority, and the rest of society. The main conclusion of the paper is that the smart card ticketing system in Trondheim delivers a positive net present value. The paper demonstrates that economic evaluation of smart card ticketing schemes using the principles of social cost-benefit analysis is desirable and possible. Because commercial non-viability may represent constraints to the implementation of such schemes, the findings presented in this paper provide valuable information to those currently working on smart card ticketing strategies.}

The data is tested using the Hadoop ecosystem for future planning and efficient usage of the energy in an IoT environment. The proposed architecture is tested in a different scenario against the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based IoT architecture in the context of energy consumption.

(2) How good (or poor) is their usability? (3) How do they handle boundary documents? In order to clear up these issues empirically, we formulated an extended criteria model for the quantification of eGovernment maturity, analyzed the average quality of the information architecture of 31 identified Informational World Cities' official websites, and studied the processing of boundary documents, i.e. documents that serve different user groups. Our outcomes indicate that the maturity and usability levels of investigated cities are much differentiated, whereas the implementation of boundary documents in form of detailed information sheets is rather scarce. Considering the maturity of investigated eGovernments, there is still potential for improvement, especially regarding the aspects of communication and transaction services. The differences between the eGovernments' usability standards are substantial and the results are partially suboptimal. Our outcomes indicate that the usability levels retrieved from task-based evaluation are not directly linked to integration of boundary documents into the governmental websites.}

This chapter specifically focuses on the various applications of smart object networks in the fields of environmental monitoring, increased public safety and security, efficient resources management such as energy and water, ITS, and the development of new social networks. All of these new applications rely on the deployment of IP smart object networks offering a high degree of scalability, reliability, and security in harsh and unattended environments. Smart object networks will consist of smart objects of various nature such as magnetic, thermal, visual, seismic, infrared, acoustic, and radar, which would be able to monitor a wide variety of ambient conditions that include temperature, humidity, sunlight, soil makeup, air makeup, noise levels, pollution, energy, presence or absence of certain kinds of objects, and mechanical stress levels. In some cases, Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies can be deployed to logically separate the flows, if required.}

However, the existing smart water systems have a wide variety of types and designs without a unified optimal evaluation method. Unlike other scientific models, the majority of end users for smart water system are the government and the public who may not be familiar with complex and academic principles, making it difficult to determine the applicability of the current system to local demands. Accordingly, we proposed an evaluation method for the smart water system based on the concept of fit-for-purpose. The proposed method enables a comprehensive evaluation in three dimensions: usefulness of the system, reliability in results, and feasibility in practice, to make sure that a smart water system can achieve the specified purposes required by the certain environment and users in its optimum state. In this study, we applied this approach to a typical smart water system with the main purpose of water system scheduling and flood control in Fuzhou, China to (1) evaluate the current system on three dimensions; and (2) reconstruct the system for identifying the improvement details that fit for intended requirements. We found that the new evaluation method showed good adaptability to the smart water system: (1) For a built smart water system, the method provides users with acceptance and improvement references through comprehensive evaluation and re-construction; (2) For a proposed smart water system, the method can contribute to pragmatic design suggestions that make the system fit for purpose from the beginning. Overall, the evaluation method based on Fit-for-Purpose can serve as the basis for future smart water and smart city, hence improving resource efficiency and facilitating the development of digital urban water management.}

abstract = {Key performance indicator (KPI) data provide candidate information required for effective network planning, performance analysis and optimization. However, inadequate KPI data could limit efficient network planning leading to escalating operational cost, and this could adversely affect the subscribers of the network. To this end, this article presents radio frequency (RF) measurements and evaluation of KPIs taken at 1876.6MHz with a bandwidth of 10MHz, for an operational 4G LTE network in Nigeria. The measurements campaign specifically examine the behaviour of the RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, SINR, PCC PHY DL Throughput, and the PDCP DL Throughput. Huawei Technologies Modem E392 was used for the propagation measurements, and RF measurements cover three evolved node base stations (eNodeBs) with average heights of 25 m. The geographical coordinates of the sites are as follows: Site 1 (Latitude 6.43543333; Longitude 3.44539667), Site 2 (Latitude 6.55639500; Longitude 3.36693333), and Site 3 (Latitude 6.51879500; Longitude 3.39911000). The E392 4G (LTE) Modem is capable of propagation measurements at the various LTE frequency bands, enables LTE download Speed of 100 Mbit/s, supports LTE upload Speed of 50 Mbit/s, utilizes LTE 2x2 MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), and supports 64QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). The Drive Test (DT) Software version-Genex prove V16, and Genex Assistance V16 were deployed, and the test car carried a test terminal station, a GPS, a Windows supported Computer, and the accompanying drive test system. The test vehicle was driven such that it considered the actual road traffic conditions at a relatively medium speed of up to 30km/h with uniformity thereby reducing possible Doppler effects. Terminal connection was established, and data download services was started (using file transfer protocol - ftp, a drive test software, which has the function to download a large file of around 20GB). Thereafter, the download simultaneous file downloading limit was set to 5 files (such that 5 files can be downloaded simultaneously with quality download speed). When connection drops, simultaneous connection was re-established using the ftp software, and drive test was carried out within a planned cluster on a bright and sunny day. Statistical descriptions and probability distribution functions of the KPI data is reported and interdependence amongst the KPIs are presented to ease understanding of the interrelationships among the tested KPIs. The data reported would find useful applications in RF planning, radio channel measurements and modelling, feasibility studies and formulation of appropriate regulatory policies for wireless communication systems. Network operators could leverage on the data for appropriate KPI analyses, radio resources management, and research and development.}

Before fully adopting e-Commerce for smart city applications, there are a few challenges that need to be addressed; mainly security and fraud risks. Here, credit cards are the most popular target, as a fraudster does not need much to carry out a 'card not present' transaction. Many techniques are used in identifying sources of cyber fraud, yet their detection accuracy degrades substantially when they are applied to datasets with an extremely large number of features and training samples. The objective of this research is to propose a new model to accurately identify sources of fraud in e-Commerce based on features extraction. This research is needed for early detection of fraud in order to avoid further occurrences of these crimes. In attaining the objectives of this research, an intensive data analysis will be performed to extract fraudulent detection patterns, which assists in constructing an effective classifier to identify sources of fraud. To construct the classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) will be used as the base of our proposed model, along with a new algorithm called the multi-verse optimizer for fraudulent features extraction. The proposed approach, the credit card fraud detection model, is based on multi-verse features extraction (CCFD-MVFEX). The significance of this research comes from its ability to optimize the accuracy of detecting sources of fraud in e-Commerce, as well as effectively training the fraud detection model on different sets of fraudulent features. This will leverage the confidence of e-Commerce users. The results illustrate that the produced features extraction model can identify fraudulent sources with high accuracy rates compared with other representative detection methods, using four online data sources.}

In this work we use the Westminster Borough of London City, as a case study to illustrate how a dynamic high-resolution dataset for the energy demands of the whole area can be analyzed using the Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) to provide insights into the urban- and sub-urban (e.g. district) scale energy demand and therefore suggest how such an analysis can be exploited to guide smart urban energy-demand management. Specifically, we analyze full-day (24-hr) evolutions of the urban-scale energy heating/cooling demands together with high-resolution information on the building density, height and the population. By introducing the scale-adaptive approach, our analysis provides suggestions for e.g. peak hour identification and localization, as well as the identification for example of best-neighboring candidate zone area for extra energy supply in case of power failures.}

abstract = {Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories , or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method.}

There are many application systems, in which both (server and user) are located at separate locations. Normally, a user requests for availing diverse facilities and a server is available to provide legal services precisely. But, a server cannot grant a right of entry to any user without verifying genuinely else an adversary has many opportunities to exploit the system or users. Hence, there is a need of well-established mutual authentication framework, which can permit legal customers to access provisions and the system can be protected against multiple security attacks. In this paper, we identified that a scheme suggested by Madhusudhan et al. cannot withstand against session key disclosure, smart card lost, and includes a security flaw regarding password update. Therefore, we suggest a new authentication protocol, which can resist upon numerous security vulnerabilities and can perform the verification process within a less time period. Furthermore, the proposed protocol performs effectively in communication, storage, and energy consumption rather than other relevant authentications mechanisms.}

Examples come from observing the process, stakeholders and products developed during the Digital Transformation of Ceará between 2019 and 2022. We build a framework that further links those examples with the SDGs and the Brazilian Letter for Smart Cities, a national set of guidelines towards equitable smart transitions. By setting the framework vis-a-vis a grounded experience, we seek to present seven components which can be adapted to other contexts as drivers of a Smart and Sustainable Governance.

Nowadays, the WLANs offer unlimited broadband practice to consumers that have been in the past provided simply to connect wirelessly equipment inside a short range. The most recent and the up-and-coming standards solve technology problems or append new features to the existing 802.11 technologies and will be expected to beat a number of standing troubles with 802.11. The current trend of new-generation wireless networks is their use in the design and the building of smart cities. This technology guarantees better and healthier cities through the implementation of environment-based applications allowed by WLAN, robust environmental sensors, and low energy consumption. WLANs can be one of the ideal solutions to implement this kind of platforms. This chapter focuses on this technology. The first part of this chapter illustrates the basics of the IEEE 802.11 standard. This includes a survey of WLAN concepts and terminology, Physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) Layers, applications of WLANs, and spread spectrum communication. In the second part of this chapter, we present the history behind the development of the standard and we detail the features of the IEEE 802 family that have been published. Then we will describe some upcoming standards and we discuss some key open problems of the IEEE 802.11 standard such as mobility, energy, security, and quality of service.

In particular, in cities with higher crime rates, effectively providing for public safety is an increasingly complex undertaking. To handle this complexity, new technologies are enabling police departments to access growing volumes of crime-related data that can be analyzed to understand patterns and trends. These technologies have potentially to increase the efficient deployment of police resources within a given territory and ultimately support more effective crime prevention. This paper presents a predictive approach based on spatial analysis and auto-regressive models to automatically detect high-risk crime regions in urban areas and to reliably forecast crime trends in each region. The algorithm result is a spatio-temporal crime forecasting model, composed of a set of crime-dense regions with associated crime predictors, each one representing a predictive model for estimating the number of crimes likely to occur in its associated region. The experimental evaluation was performed on two real-world datasets collected in the cities of Chicago and New York City. This evaluation shows that the proposed approach achieves good accuracy in spatial and temporal crime forecasting over rolling time horizons.}

However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers’ attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers’ behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.}

The chapter discusses various DER, from renewable generation to demand response, and gets into the details of underlying digital components that form the foundation of OT+IT (operational and information technologies) systems for transactive energy and smart microgrids. The energy markets, both short and long term, pricing strategies and scheduling are topics that utilities used to care, and now the customers will have to understand and participate. Smart microgrids and transactive energy are described starting from electric and IT system architecture, along with the key functionality of energy management. As this new field evolves, several key observations, considerations, and challenges are presented that will be major topics to watch out for new practitioners.

abstract = {The impending scarcity of the available natural resources can be addressed by streamlining sustainable energy sources. The investigation done in this work aimed at the selection of a location and design of a sustainable city in Jordan. The complexity of choosing a location arose due to the semiarid climate coupled with very limited conventional energy resources. In narrowing down the selection process, the authors developed a selection criterion for a sustainable city in Jordan. Based on that criterion, the north of King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba was determined to be the optimal location. This location has exceptional renewable energy resources and is close to the sea. The proposed sustainable city was designed to house 50,000 inhabitants and a total area of 11,128,508m2. 26% of this area was used for renewable energy projects, 27.4% for housing, 16.1% area for agricultural use, 21.2% for public and green areas, and 9.3% for waste treatment and industrial zone. Smart grid was utilized to satisfy the energy needs for any sustainable site, which included energy management and storage. The electrical load of the proposed city was estimated based on the domestic and commercial electrical load of the city of Aqaba. The load has a peak of 24.78MW and total energy consumption of 122.18 GWh. The city water demand was estimated, domestic water was stored in distributed tanks. A central 5873m3 water storage tank was selected for emergency, agricultural, and other uses. Moreover, this tank served as energy storage medium. Since excess energy was used to desalinate water and the desalinated water was stored in this tank. Two-energy generation scenarios were studied, first, the use of CSP parabolic trough with thermal energy storage yielded an LCOE of 0.1697 USD/kWh. Second, the use of a hybrid, PV, and wind, the system with battery storage resulted in an LCOE 0.0748 USD/kWh for full load coverage. However, the LCOE in the city, if it were connected to the Jordanian national grid without battery storage, was estimated to be 0.0344 USD/kWh.}

Regardless of this objective, building a comfortable and sustainable city for the citizens by putting the quality of life at the center of the city, is one of these responsibilities. In fact, the issue of the way how city administrations change especially with global and technological changes requires a detailed analysis. In this context, critical issues like transportation, health, education, energy, and environment are among the topics to be examined. Of course, rather than providing these services by their names, the responsibilities of meeting the services, the management procedures, the economic and technological situation of the city, the forms of urban intervention against the risks and problems that may occur, and the sustainability of the service are very important. The reason for looking at these services on a city-specific basis is that urban infrastructures use a large proportion of energy usage outside the large production-oriented facilities. Water, energy, and transportation are the most critical infrastructures in the growing cities with increasing population. Moreover, it is unchanging that in the 2050s, probably about 60% of the world’s population will live in cities. In this study, recommendations are given about how an ideal city management should be in some of the critical city services and current state-of-the-art studies are listed.}

The system has been developed to assist the surveillance system in the world heritage city (WHC) or restricted area through the CCTV camera in detecting the trespassers, when the WHC is closed. This data can be used not only for the surveillance purpose but also for the commercial strategic planning and the security community as well. For example, the number of participants, audience, or visitors who attend the event can be used to plan the upcoming event. In developing the world heritage city surveillance system using smart CCTV, the developers adapted the knowledge about image processing to detect and count the number of people-in and people-out from video data and to security for the system. The system was tested on three set of video data and the results reveal 80-90% accuracy rate. Most of the errors occur when the background area is dark or when people walk in a group but the ability to control critical analysis of communication data to the agency administrator can control the order to increase security for tourists and maintain the condition of the remains a world heritage site.}

This paper provides additional empirical insights into spatiotemporal urban mobility patterns and their relationship with urban form and land use using station-based average travel distances (ATDs). Drawing on smart card data of the Nanjing metro system, land use data and open source points-of-interest (POIs) data, we apply exploratory spatial data and quantile regression analysis to examine distance patterns and explore the potential effects of urban form and land use calculated at different spatial scales (i.e. 800 m, 2 km and 5 km) on the ATDs. By comparing mobility patterns between weekdays and weekends and for different times of day, our findings highlight that ATDs are not uniformly nor randomly distributed in space. Positive spatial autocorrelation is found for different time segments. The results of OLS and quantile regression models show a positive and robust relationship between ATDs and distances to the city center (DCs). The models also prove that land use mix (especially measured at the 2 km and 5 km scale) significantly affects ATDs, supporting the importance of land use mix in decreasing daily travel distances. No significant relationship is found between ATDs and distances to the nearest subsidiary center (DSCs), while the employment/entertainment-residence balance has a marginal effect on ATDs at relatively large spatial scales (i.e. 2 km, 5 km). Consequently, with respect to reducing the ATDs, we recommend enhancing land use mix and reducing the imbalance between employment/entertainment and residence at larger spatial scales. Potential applications and future research directions are discussed. The findings in the present paper are helpful for guiding urban planning and policy making.}

Most of existing urban energy platforms are focused on short-term analysis (present or 2020) and cover specific sectors and/or aspects, without considering the holistic optimisation of the whole energy system. Moreover, usually these platforms can only be operated by users with high technical skills. This article presents the design and development of the innovative SureCity Platform which aims to overcome existing gaps to support cities to achieve their mid-to-long term sustainability targets. The main novelties the SureCity platform are: (i) it is a transparent and user-friendly software which can also be used by non-technical staff, such as politicians; (ii) it allows assessment of urban policies and measures through holistic optimisation of the whole energy system towards low carbon energy systems including air quality, land-use and water use at city level. Furthermore, since it is based on a generic comprehensive model, the SureCity platform can be adjusted and applied to a large number of cities. Because it is generalised, it has been developed using a participatory approach with different city stakeholders, and since it is designed to be used by users with different levels of expertise, it can also improve communication among city actors and benchmarking with other cities.}

By the technology of the IoT, the world will becomes smart in many aspects such as cities which are the main poles of human and economic activity. Analyzing cities data is very important to improve the city economy as well as the life quality of the citizens. Since location based services and GPS devices can easily connect users located in different positions, it is worthwhile to optimize the efficiency of their shifting to a common location according to their preferences. However, in many real-life applications, uncertain, imprecise and incomplete data inherently exist. By the advent of such applications, the effective processing of advanced analysis queries such as the skyline for imperfect data has become important. Basically, the skyline query finds the interesting objects according to a user preferences. Answering spatial skyline query for a set of query points can find many applications in Geographical Information Systems. However, the traditional skyline queries cannot answer a users group needs and are not sufficient to obtain a good choice for all group members. In this paper, we propose a spatial skyline query over imperfect data related to set of query points located at different positions. We propose an imperfect spatial skyline query for users located in different positions. Detailed experimental analysis is reported. In addition, the theoretical properties developed in this paper help to devise efficient techniques to compute the spatial skyline over uncertain data for a set of users. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms provide quick initial response time.}

There has been a rise in the use of efficient systems to enhance built environment control and accomplish infrastructure development projects, and for this to be successful, countries around the globe, including Nigeria, need robust smart cities and buildings. Few researchers have looked at how smart cities and building projects might improve the sustainability practices of Nigeria's built environment in the context of environmental issues. The major research aim of this study is to investigate the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in advancing urban sustainability in the context of Lagos, Nigeria, amidst the city's rapid population growth and the implementation of smart city projects. The study's research questions include the following: First, How can information and communication technology (ICT) be leveraged to support the development of urban sustainability? Secondly, what is the impact of ICT on stakeholders' involvement and participation in urban sustainability? Thirdly, how can stakeholders' involvement and participation impact urban sustainability? Structural equation modeling using partial least squares (SmartPLS 3.0 Edition) as an analysis tool was used to assess the suggested model and the empirical study results in support of all the hypothesized associations. Results revealed that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is positively associated with smart urban sustainability. Also, a positive and significant influence of ICT on consolidating stakeholder involvement and participation is paramount. Lastly, smart city and building initiatives have the potential to significantly improve urban sustainability. The implication of the study enables the possibility to optimize the impact of an ICT-based urban environment, thereby creating sustainable and resilient communities that meet the needs and priorities of all members of society.}

In such a context, and reflecting the specificities of the Chinese political economy system for urbanization, the central role of multilevel political leadership and state authorities for the planning and implementation of the innovation site is identified. In addition the analysis reveals the discursive and material influence of a Chinese world-leading Internet corporation, as well as the importance of onsite incubators and governmental supportive policies for the innovation process. At the same time the smart project is found to encounter challenges in terms of market promotion of innovation products and the integration of social, economic, and environmental considerations.

abstract = {As typical applications in the field of the cloud computing, cloud storage services are popular in the development of smart cities for their low costs and huge storage capacity. Proofs-of-ownership (PoW) is an important cryptographic primitive in cloud storage to ensure that a client holds the whole file rather than part of it in secure client side data deduplication. The previous PoW schemes worked well when the file is in plaintext. However, the privacy of the clients’ data may be vulnerable to honest-but-curious attacks. To deal with this issue, the clients tend to encrypt files before outsourcing them to the cloud, which makes the existing PoW schemes inapplicable any more. In this paper, we first propose a secure zero-knowledge based client side deduplication scheme over encrypted files. We prove that the proposed scheme is sound, complete and zero-knowledge. The scheme can achieve a high detection probability of the clients’ misbehavior. Then we introduced a proxy re-encryption based key distribution scheme. This scheme ensures that the server knows nothing about the encryption key even though it acts as a proxy to help distributing the file encryption key. It also enables the clients who have gained the ownership of a file to share the file with the encryption key generated without establishing secure channels among them. It is proved that the clients’ private key cannot be recovered by the server or clients collusion attacks during the key distribution phase. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is much more efficient than the existing client side deduplication schemes.}

The control-oriented building model was developed with a grey-box model structure based on the experimental data to predict the indoor air temperature. Based on the model, the operation cost-saving potential of the MPC was investigated in a single house with different comfort levels, electricity prices, and prediction horizons. The cost-saving of the MPC was approximately 10.6 % compared to the conventional control. The MPC was expanded to a residential building cluster considering the peak demand charge. In an hourly shedding and load-up scenario, the performances of the MPC and the heuristic prior-based control (PBC) are promising. When shedding was enforced all day, the peak demand saving of the MPC was 36∼38 %, whereas that of the PBC was 25.7 % compared to the baseline. In addition, the monthly electricity bill, including the operation and peak demand cost, was investigated with different demand charge rates and weather conditions. The total saving decreased with a low demand charge rate and hot conditions, and the operation cost saving was compromised with more aggressive demand shedding.}

The insufficiency of centralized human control mechanism over cities’ resource and function management framework led the evolution of the smart city concept that essentially counts on the communications between different networks. However, the deployment of electronic components that can carry both the decision-making mechanisms and the functional capacity to perform the necessary action is economically impossible to afford. This impossibility brings out an older approach of separating the decision-making and the application parts. The decision-making part can handle the data from different networks and make smart decisions according to the predefined constraints and trusted control resources. The derived decisions are sent over secure channels to the actuators that can perform physical tasks to change its surroundings. Even though the definition presents an illusion of simplicity, the design, implementation, and control of two separated yet correlated network structure are not trivial. The decentralized structure of data networks, for example, Internet of Thing (IoT) network and wireless sensor node (WSN), and ineffective scheduling algorithms result in a challenging durability problem for control frameworks. Self-Organized Network (SON) frameworks enable a self-aware system structure that can adjust network resources according to the user needs. In this chapter, as the main focus is the durability of the actuator network, we proposed a SON-based centralized control scheme. Through this chapter the observed actuator devices are cyber physical devices (CPDs) and the actuator network will be named as CPD network. With the objective of maintaining the highest coverage ratio with the minimum number of CPD devices, we used Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) coefficient and Conflict Ratio for each CPD device. Using a probabilistic approach, the number of minimum active devices to fulfill the user expectations is determined. Using LISA coefficient and Conflict Ratio, the centralized controller determines a schedule for IoT devices. In this study, in order to maintain the connection with the generality, a layered CPD device network is considered where all CPD devices at the same layer are the same. Different CPD devices are considered to be in different layers and the controller can optimize each layer separately.}

The main problem of DMAPS is to provide with purified air in the outdoors, such as a residential colony, in apartments, office complex, etc. since most of the times people travel outdoors and stay away from their home for a long time. This ability of providing with such a smart-sensing, self-driving machine is the advantage of the paper because other air purifiers exist but they are made for indoors, they do not have mobility and also do not possess AI capabilities. The method used in this air purifier is formulated by connecting three major functions. The first one being, ‘the smart mobility’ of the machine using the approach of deep reinforcement learning, the second is the air ‘purification using the Arduino system’ and the last is, ‘the detection of humans’ so that DMAPS can be around them and provide them with purified air, based on the YOLO algorithm. The whole system, works in a way that each and every function is very much connected and works simultaneously. In a nutshell, this air purifier, moves from one place (where there is low pollution content) to another place (where there is higher pollution content), purifies the environment and simultaneously have an objective to smartly detect humans to give out fresh air to them. Hence, in this way the whole methodology tries to fix the problem of air pollution by purifying the air outdoors to make it safe to inhale.}

Governance, seen as the process of identifying the scope of interrelations around us and ways of how to best link them together in the city/urban space, is vital in view of attaining a city’s sustainability. This includes the prospect of attaining the targets specific to SDG11, and in no contradiction to the definitions of governance, in relation to governmental reign and processes. The objective of this chapter is to review the debate on urban development and governance to identify how these two strands of the debate address the issue of sustainability. Against this backdrop, a thorough discussion on urban design is geared toward the attainment of the SDGs.}

The entire trafficscape of the city of Kolkata evolved as the efficiency of the mass transport services declined, disposable income of the majority increased. There was gradual privatisation with increase in the share of para-transit modes. As the literate, technologically conversant urban population wanted a smarter alternative to regular taxis and auto rickshaws the app-based cab aggregator services brought in the silent revolution in the transport communication system. The main objectives of the paper are to bring out the essence of changing scenario, to access qualitatively and quantitatively that how far analysis of big data and reliance on technology through ICT and IoT has been able to meet the gap between expected and actual service delivery of the said para-transit mode through SWOT analysis, regression analysis and perception studies involving primary and secondary database and to have an idea about the future trajectory of this emerging app cab market. The study found that though majority of the commuters were satisfied with availability, reliability, cost effectiveness, safety, cashless option, driver behaviour, comfort and absence of bargaining there were issues regarding transparency and surge pricing. The drivers too were content with their improved earnings but were unhappy with the long hours and were apprehensive with regular incentive cuts. So, the situation is volatile with promising future if the companies manage to balance between the virtual capabilities and actual reality.}

Technological innovations such as smart connected products, the Internet of Things, and digital twins are driving the development of smart management systems. Investments in necessary product-service systems are justified by cost savings and improved service quality, especially in affluent societies like Switzerland. However, there is a trade-off between cost savings and service quality that raises the question of optimal balance. Using a Swiss municipality as an example, this paper models the trade-off between cost savings and service quality using waste bin sensor modules. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of cost savings on service quality reduction and that substantial cost savings are possible without a service quality compromise. We also introduce a digital process twin as a decision support system that is able to leverage a growing database. These results contribute to research, firstly through the field study with 98 waste bins equipped with fill level sensor modules, secondly through the model-based analysis of the trade-off between cost savings and service quality, and thirdly by conceptualizing a digital twin-based decision support system. The results further contribute to practice, firstly by providing benchmarks for implementing similar systems in other municipalities without having to create their own simulations, secondly by presenting an innovative key performance indicator to measure service quality, and thirdly with a model that can be used for simulations to determine the individual optimum between costs and service quality.}

abstract = {In energy sectors, power utilities face financial losses due to Electricity Theft (ET). It happens when electricity is consumed without billing. Several methods are developed to detect ET automatically. Most of these methods only assess Electricity Consumption (EC) records. However, it is challenging to detect fraudulent consumers by only observing EC records because of diverse theft strategies (line tapping, meter tampering, etc.) and the irregularity of ET behavior. Furthermore, many methods have poor classification accuracy due to imbalanced data. This work proposes two novel methods to resolve the above-mentioned issues: Tomek Link Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Support Vector Machine (TBSSVM) and Temporal Convolutional Network with Enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (TCN-EMLP). The former resamples the data by balancing the majority and minority class instances. Whereas, the latter classifies normal and fraudulent consumers. Moreover, deep learning models suffer from high variance in their final results due to the assignment of different weights. Therefore, an averaging ensemble strategy is applied in this work to reduce the high variance. Furthermore, State Grid Cooperation of China (SGCC) and Pakistan Residential Electricity Consumption (PRECON) datasets are used in this paper for performing the simulations. SGCC is an imbalanced and labeled dataset while PRECON is an unlabeled dataset comprised of normal consumers' EC records (sequential) and auxiliary (non-sequential) data. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines, i.e., wide and deep convolutional neural network, extreme gradient boosting, long short-term memory with multi-layer perceptron, etc., in terms of ET detection.}

These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.}

In contrast, less crime and better schools appear to be unimportant city amenities for each education group. Moreover, I also find that there is significant heterogeneity in the estimated marginal willingness to pay for some city amenities.
要約
本論文では、移動選択モデルを使い、頭が良い人々(smart people)を惹きつけるには、都市のどのようなアメニティーが重要かを分析する。若年層では教育水準を問わず、人口はそれなりに多く、しかし人口密度は低く、教育水準の高い住民が住み、住民の民族性が多様で、所得格差が少なく、冬は温かい都市を選好することが分かる。対照的に、どの教育水準グループでも、犯罪率が低く優良な学校があることなどは、都市アメニティーとして重視されていないようである。さらに、都市アメニティーによっては限界支払意志額の推定額には大きな差が見られる。
Resumen
Este artículo aplica un modelo de elección de migración para examinar qué servicios urbanos son importantes para atraer a personas inteligentes. Se encontró que los jóvenes con diferentes niveles de educación prefieren las ciudades con más población, una densidad de población más baja, la presencia de residentes con un mayor nivel educativo, una población racialmente diversa, menor desigualdad de ingresos, y un invierno más cálido. En contraste, una menor delincuencia y mejores escuelas parecen tener poca importancia como servicios urbanos para cada grupo con diferente nivel de educación. Por otra parte, se encontró también que existe una heterogeneidad significativa en la disposición marginal estimada de pagar por ciertos servicios urbanos.}

However, the cost of deploying large-scale testbeds to analyze the performance of these solutions is prohibitively huge. Therefore, cooperative ITS simulation platforms are essential to test the performance of such solutions before their actual deployment. In order to fulfill this requirement we have developed PySNS3 (a Python-based framework for bidirectional coupling between NS3 and SUMO). To test the robustness and reliability of proposed framework we have compared its mobility as well as communication related simulation results with state-of-the-art NS2-mobility-model. We have performed a simulation scenario of Harbin city that includes evaluation of 802.11p MAC/PHY characteristics, the architecture of Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE), and prediction of the vehicular Edge computation capacity. We have also performed the evaluation of a traffic efficiency application using proposed framework to reduce the fuel consumption and waiting time. The simulation results proved that the proposed framework can offer dynamic coupling between SUMO and NS3 for the evaluation of Edge computing solutions of ITS for future city models.}

Over the years a large body of work has focused on how these technologies can be harnessed to engage urban dwellers in local issues and to give them a platform to share their opinions. Despite this, situated digital technologies created for community engagement with “best intentions in mind” are not always relevant to the context of where they are located. These technologies are often unable to adapt to the variable conditions of the space and changing needs of urban dwellers within them. This issue of relevance is amplified due to the increasing hyperconnectedness of modern society, where information has become readily available through personal smart devices. While there is much understanding of how situated digital technologies can be designed so that they are relevant to the context of place and space, there is currently no up-to-date set of principles that define how they should be designed to be relevant to individual urban dwellers within their respective communities. To address this gap, we propose a smart engagement approach to investigate the factors that make situated digital technologies relevant to individual urban dwellers. From a discussion of previous work and reflection of our own studies, we then present six design patterns within the context of making situated digital technologies relevant.}

The ultimate objective of the research is to propose a rural ecological space control system centered around “regionalization-network-stationing”. As suggested by the research results, in Sanshui River Basin, the area of suitable development zone, ecological control buffer zone, and ecological conservation zone is 467.35 km2, 538.86 km2 and 317.34 km2, accounting for 35.31%, 40.74% and 23.95% of the basin respectively; a basin rural ecological corridor network structure featuring “one core, one vertical line and three horizontal lines” has been constituted; approximately 387 villages are based in suitable construction development zone, 169 in ecological control buffer zone, and 82 in ecological conservation zone. The research is expected to provide scientific evidence for sustainable rural development and rational use of ecological environmental resources in Sanshui River Basin, afford specific technical support to territorial spatial planning, and reinforce space control scientificity and practicability.}

However, less attention has been paid to the fundamental role of citizens in smart cities. So far, citizen participation with a responsive approach has not been studied, and there have been few quantitative studies on self-organization in citizen participation development. Nowadays, the paradigm of the citizen's role has changed. In the past, citizens had one-sided participation, but now smart citizens must actively participate in urban affairs as well as use modern technologies. This issue depends on legal and social infrastructures to achieve smart citizen participation. One of the recent developments in information technology is the changing concept of smart cities to responsive cities. So far, the focus of smart cities has been on the capabilities that organizations provide to citizens, but in responsive cities, citizens actively participate through activities that promote participation, such as open data, online platforms, living labs, and direct interaction. Additionally, the city is self-organized and uses digital capabilities. Therefore, this study aims to develop citizen participation in a responsive city with a self-organized approach. Based on prior research, a research model was designed, and a questionnaire was distributed among Tehran residents to analyze their participation in a responsive city. Regression analysis was utilized for calculations and analyzing data. The overall evaluation of the model indicated that variables in a responsive city such as open data, online platforms, and living labs only have an impact on citizen participation if there is self-organization. According to the results, only the variable of direct interaction affects citizen participation, while open data, online platforms, and living labs do not have an impact, and their effect depends on self-organization.}

Three monitoring techniques are presented: one based on monitoring the “pulse” of a location, one on the “pace” of individual vehicle trajectories over time, and a third on the “travel momentum” of a population. The travel momentum is linked to time geography and is characterized by vector fields in space-time. Examples demonstrate its use to track scalar flow as well as direction, which in turn can be used to measure “impulses” or change in momentum as a before-after study. It can also be used to quantify its spatial-temporal relation with transport systems or points of interest through vector projections. The advantage of the travel momentum fields is that initial trajectory information can be preprocessed so that online updates are made possible with computationally cheap updates.}

In this technique, both the mobile user (Ui) and the service provider (Sj) are required to prove their legitimacy to each other, and hence the legitimate Ui can utilize all the cloud computing services in an efficient and secure way.

While developing nations have thus far been sheltered from obligations to reduce carbon emissions, we cannot anticipate that this situation will continue. Within this context developing nations need to follow a very different development path from that established by first world countries. This development path is a low-energy, low-carbon, and generally a resource-efficient one. Economies across the world need to change the assumptions of this paradigm in order to build a sustainable reality. As financial and environmental impacts soar, the real costs of resource inputs and of waste generation need to increasingly be taken into account. These factors are making efficiency, conservation, reuse, recycling, and renewable energy sources primary considerations for a healthy economy.}

abstract = {In the late 2010s, publics in the UK encountered new kinds of street furniture: Strawberry Energy Smart benches in London and InLinkUK kiosks in Glasgow, with smart features such as phone charging, free Wi-Fi, free phone calls, information screens and environmental data. This article analyses how smart street furniture is socially constructed by relevant social groups, each with different interests, forms of power and meanings. Smartness became associated not only with advanced technologies, but with a neoliberal agenda of private-public partnerships promising urban transformations, such as free devices for councils and citizens in exchange for access to advertising or sponsorship space in public places. The research examined the design, use and governance of new types of smart street furniture using mixed methods, including document analysis of promotional and regulatory texts, site observations of these devices, and interviews. We found that the uses and meanings of these devices were discovered at different moments by technology companies, local councils, and the public. Few members of the public knew about the devices, and showed little interest in them, even if they were the assumed users. An exception was gig workers and people experiencing homelessness who found uses for the smart features and a community activist who campaigned against these as surveillant and intrusive. Businesses and councils embraced smart city visions but took multiple approaches to agreements for the implementation and governance of smart street furniture. Notably, these more powerful groups discovered and negotiated the meanings of smart street furniture well before these were publicly encountered. This article reveals how a social construction of technology (SCOT) approach is strongest when it accounts for the relative power of social groups in struggles over meanings and resources. It provides empirical information on everyday sociotechnical encounters that provide nuanced evidence for wider critiques of smart city agendas.}

abstract = {In the past three decades, the Internet has undergone major evolutions. It started as a content sharing platform with early websites, portals, and search engines. Information on the Internet became richer and more diverse, especially with the increase of users worldwide; the Internet is no longer connecting information but also connecting people. Social networks emerged in addition to other services such as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and video chat that empowered the social web. This shift transformed the end user from a consumer of information to a major contributor and producer of data. This trend has taken on an exponential slope with the advent of smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In addition to data, smartphone accelerated a shift in communications as well. A new communication mode has enabled information access anytime and anywhere where end users need to interact with their environment for basic daily tasks. For instance, in major metropolitan cities, calling a taxi service is now done at the push of a button using the mobile device through application services such as Uber. Having connected information with users at early stages and then users with other users through social web, the Internet is evolving to connect objects, homes, cities, and just about everything that is connectable and can benefit from being connected. This leads to an intelligent and context-aware platform that enables all kinds of smart services. In this chapter, we discuss this new trend of connected objects in the context of smart homes and cities, and their challenges, as well as perform a survey of related key enabling technologies.}

abstract = {Smart infrastructures aim more efficient and accurate methods of routine inspection for long-term monitoring of the infrastructure to make smarter decision on maintenance and rehabilitation. Although some recent technologies (i.e., robotic techniques) that are currently in practice can collect objective, quantified data, the inspector’s own expertise is still critical in many instances. Yet, these technologies are designed to replace human expertise, or are ineffective in terms of saving time and labor. This chapter investigates a new methodology for structural inspections with the help of mixed reality technology and real-time machine learning to accelerate certain tasks of the inspector such as detection, measurement, and assessment of defects, and easy accessibility to defect locations. A functional, real-time machine learning system that can be ideally deployed in mixed reality devices and headsets which can be used by inspectors during their routine concrete infrastructure inspection is introduced. The deep learning models to be employed in the AI system can localize a concrete defect in real time and further analyze it by performing pixel wise segmentation while running on a mobile device architecture. First, a sufficiently large database of concrete defect images is gathered from various sources including publicly available crack and spalling datasets, real-world images taken during bridge inspections, and the public images from the internet search results. For defect localization, various state-of-the-art deep learning model architectures are investigated based on their memory allocation, inference speed, and flexibility to deploy different deep learning platforms. YoloV5s model was found to be the optimal model architecture for concrete defect localization to be deployed in the mixed reality system. For defect quantification, several segmentation architectures with three different classification backbones are trained on the collected image dataset with segmentation labels. Based on the model evaluation results, the PSPNet with EfficientNet-b0 backbone is found to be the best performing model in terms of inference speed and accuracy. The selected models for defect localization and quantification are deployed to the mixed reality platform and image tracking libraries are configured in the platform environment, and accurate distance estimation is accomplished using a calibration process. Lastly, a methodology for condition assessment of concrete defects using the mixed reality system is discussed. The proposed methodology can locate and track the defects using the mixed reality platform, which can eventually be transferred to cloud data and potentially used for remote assessments or updating a digital twins or BIMs.}

abstract = {Thanks to increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to understand how ecological processes function. In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using time- and cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.}
