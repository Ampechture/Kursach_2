abstract = {By determining the elasticity of capital-land substitution in housing construction, this research evaluates the impact that anti-sprawl, smart growth policies promoting higher land prices can have on housing prices. Analysis for Gaborone, Botswana captures the city's sprawling nature by showing that residential housing density is constant and low across the metropolitan area. Elasticity of capital-land substitution is determined for this city by regression analyses both for the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) and for the Variable Elasticity of Substitution (VES) production functions. Results for the metropolitan area and for three municipalities within that area show that deregulation of land markets across the city, together with flexibility on building density and subsidized capital, could minimize sprawl and at the same time achieve affordable housing in Gaborone.}

Existing sound recognition models use deep learning models to classify the source of sound which requires high computational resources. The extracted features do not provide optimal resolution for all types of sound sources in the domestic environment. The low-complexity sound recognition system developed for residential settings encompasses an approach to identifying the source of sound based on S-transform that provides good resolution in both time and frequency domains of the spectrum of the signal irrespective of the type of audio signal and extracting spectral spread, spectral roll-off, spectral flux, and GTCC coefficients. The SVM machine learning classifier is used to classify the source of sound in the domestic environment using the condensed set of features while maintaining minimal computational overhead. The low-complexity algorithm obtained an accuracy of 80% in the validation phase and 60% while deployed in a real-time environment.}

abstract = {Climate change is altering weather patterns, leading to increased variability in cloud cover, precipitation, and temperature. These changing patterns make it more challenging to accurately forecast solar radiation levels, which directly impact solar energy generation. This study, evaluates the solar energy potential using a real-time GSM-based communication system combined with an off-grid PV power plant in Tehran and Ahvaz, two regions in Iran with contrasting climates. To measure the output voltage, C++ language programming was used in Arduino_IDE programming language was utilized along with an Arduino Nano board, ATmega328P microcontroller, and sensors for measuring current, voltage, temperature, humidity, and time. The recorded data was sent through short message service. The results were compared with simulations from PVsyst, PVGIS, and the Global Solar Atlas. The findings revealed that the PV power production potential in Tehran, which is characterized by a cold and wet climate, was 4.101 kwh.kwp −1 with a capacity factor of 17.09%. In contrast, Ahvas, with its warm and dry climate, had a potential of 3.271 kwh.kwp −1 and a capacity factor of 13.63%. These values differed significantly from the estimates provided by PVsyst and the Global Solar Atlas. The Global Solar Atlas overestimated the PV potential by 15% and 18.2% in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively, while PVsyst underestimated it by more than 15% in both locations. The real-time energy production was measured at 246.1 Wh and 196.27 Wh, compared to the estimated values of 283 Wh and 232 Wh from the Global Solar Atlas, 178.36 Wh and 142.63 Wh from PVsyst, and 221.4 Wh and 196.9 Wh from PVGIS in Tehran and Ahvaz, respectively. These results underscore the importance of accounting for recent climate changes when predicting near real-time solar generation, particularly in remote areas and regions that deviate from global trends.}

Transformative computing in the fourth-generation industrialization, receives all signals and all sequences from sensing devices under artificial intelligence in wireless networking. Then the system has to combine them and make a useful information for human. In an industrial building or in a home, many electronic devices would be using and they make various energy signals and sequences. The devices can find out the energy wastage in the absence of a smart energy management system to monitor the energy flow, and it causes a blackout. Once the energy flow is analysed, it is possible to realize the special-time or the rush-time, which will require a large amount of energy. Because the existing systems have no monitor to see the energy flow, a large amount of energy can be wasted. To distribute the energy efficiently, a smart energy management system should have the necessary special functions that can monitor the energy flow. Following the analysis result, the system can create a special strategy to plan energy distribution. In this study, the smart energy management system defines a special strategy based on the analysis result of the consumed energy by arranging more or less usage of energy. Moreover, the system can decrease the energy supply to idle devices and the connected extra devices by analysing how many IoT will be used in a service. This smart control system can detect human behaviour when they move and turn in activation automatically, so finally, the system can use the energy efficiently.}

Current estimations assume customer post meter leakage accounts for up to 10% of total water consumption, particularly in the residential sector. Households identified as having post meter leakage using a citywide installation of smart metering technology were subjected to a mix of basic and tailored information regarding water loss. The primary aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of communication interventions and the attributed water savings resulting from the repair of household leaks. The residential leakage communication strategy resulted in a reduction in minimum night flows by a very significant 89% over the duration of the study, while the control group receiving no communication increased consumption by 52%. Moreover, questionnaire surveys were conducted to establish the significant factors, including leak type, demographics and household awareness, to name a few, that will influence the development of a fit-for-purpose post-meter leak rectification policy and program. The paper concludes with some key recommendations for future work to develop a predictive model for identifying, classifying and quantifying post meter loss as well as presents least cost planning implications of a leak rectification policy. The study confirmed that smart metering provides water utilities with a powerful tool to rapidly identify and action the significant volumes of post meter leakage occurring in our cities.}

Triboelectric properties of the PDMS composites were measured using copper foil as electrodes and PDMS/conducting polymer nanocomposite as the triboelectric material. The effect of various dopants such as (+) D camphor sulfonic acid (CSA), para-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TSA), acetic acid (AcOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sulphuric acid (H2SO4), on TENG properties was studied and the CSA doped PANI incorporated composite shows the highest output among all. The PDMS/CSA doped PANI (5 wt%) exhibited the highest open circuit voltage and short circuit current density of 50.2 V and 16.25 mA/m2 respectively, in the contact separation mode with a power output of 280.37 mW/m2. Also, the thickness of the nanocomposite has a profound effect on the triboelectric output responses of the prepared TENG. The optimized TENG is used to fabricate a self-powered sensor device for real-time position monitoring of individuals by incorporating the TENG module in a shoe. The triboelectric smart shoes act as a potential candidate for monitoring the real-time position of the individual through the signals received in mobile phones, thereby ensuring safety.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a project called GreenSCIES; an InnovateUK funded detailed design project to develop a Smart Local Energy System (SLES) delivering a significant carbon saving for local residents, schools and businesses. The SLES is centred around a 5th Generation District Heating and Cooling (5DHC) network in the London Borough of Islington. The local energy system will deliver low carbon heating, cooling, power and e-mobility charging powered by renewable energy and waste heat, sourced from the local area. The proposed SLES will manage and balance the supply, storage (both thermal and electrical) and use of local energy across mobility, power and heat vectors. It will do so using smart control technologies, bringing significant energy efficiency and security as well as social, environmental and economic benefits to Islington. The paper introduces the holistic SLES design approach developed by the GreenSCIES consortium, building upon an initial feasibility study previously published by the authors. The design methodology described takes technical and commercial aspects of a SLES design into account, whilst also explaining the importance of effective stakeholder engagement and co-design with local communities. The paper also provides a technical overview around the intended operation of ambient loop and heat pumps alongside long and short term thermal energy storage. A technical approach selected for integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) is also discussed in detail, alongside the control system architecture developed for the integrated SLES. The paper subsequently moves into demonstrating the benefits of the integrated SLES through a focused scheme design called New River, demonstrating integrated SLES performance compared to conventional systems in a real setting, through a comprehensive energy model. The results presented from a techno-economic analysis demonstrate that significant carbon savings and an attractive internal rate of return of (10%) can be achieved. The results presented show that even the smaller constructible “New River” scheme will save more 5000 tons of CO2e annually. This is a reduction in carbon emissions by 80% over conventional systems and, therefore a major decarbonisation solution in large cities across the world. The GreenSCIES approach presented in this paper is replicable worldwide and could become a central part of delivering nations’ net zero carbon strategy.}

The widespread installation of smart meters offers a novel route to access such data, but in countries like Great Britain (GB) consent is required from each household; a real barrier to large-scale sampling. In this paper we show how certain study design choices can impact the response rate for energy studies requesting access to half-hourly smart meter data and (optional) survey completion. We used a randomised control trial (RCT) with a 3×2×2 factorial design; 3 (including none) incentive groups ×2 message content/structures ×2 ‘push-to-web’ treatment groups. Up to 4 mailings (letters) were sent to 18,000 addresses, recruiting 1711 participants (9.5% response rate) in England and Wales. The most effective strategy offered a conditional £5 voucher and postal response options in multiple mailings (compared to only once in the push-to-web approach, although at the expense of far fewer online signups). Motivational headlines and message structure were also found to be influential. Reminders increased response but a 4th mailing was not cost effective. Our results and recommendations can be used to help future energy studies to achieve greater response rates and improved representation. UK-based researchers can apply to use our longitudinal smart meter and contextual datasets.}

The case study expands on experimental learning and examples from the Violence Prevention through Urban Upgrading (VPUU) programme reviewing the co-creation, activation and monitoring of [in]formal public space through smart learning networks. A methodology for socially activated, safe public spaces based on the VPUU Urban Design Guidelines forms the framework for design, maintenance, information and communication technology for development (through the CitySpec/CheckIT app), and intervention with community, government and stakeholders. This chapter describes VPUU’s approach to discovery and social enhancement of the vernacular urban design of a public space system, known as emthonjeni, deriving from many years of negotiated development amongst the settlement makers of an informal settlement in Khayelitsha. The case study disrupts the conventional meaning of smart urbanism, by acknowledging diverse and local opportunities for learning and service networks using digital technology and communication in a transitional and highly vulnerable context.}

This restriction aims quite logically at preventing damages while safeguarding the integrity of the cultural reserve, which is primarily characterised by its uniqueness. Nevertheless, in cases where museum visitors are visually impaired, the inability to touch the artefacts makes the whole experience incomplete as the haptic perception of an artefact’s morphology is the primary substitute of sight. In this paper, we work towards a low-cost haptic ban removal by an initial establishment of a range of requirement specifications focused on the concept of a smart exhibit which is defined as a physical object that replicates the morphological features of an actual artefact while belonging in an ICT infrastructure that exploits features common in Internet of Things devices. We present a set of high level specifications and functionalities that could be offered by a smart exhibit and objectively justify them through a process of gaining feedback from individuals with and without visual impairments. More specifically, we performed an interview-based questionnaire which in combination with a custom-built haptic performance assessment object composed a sustainable environment to collect user requirements and preferences. The questionnaire itemises user portraying in relation to museum visit experiences and accessibility tools, smart exhibit interaction and recorded narrations preferences, cultural heritage haptic exploration experiences and 3D printing derivatives. On the other hand, the haptic assessment object contributes on evaluating the suitability of reference design elements, when producing low-cost (fused filament fabrication) tactile-enabled artefacts and maps. We present the various results and indicators that contribute in composing a set of requirements specifications and good practices that will enable their exploitation in the Epigraphic Museum (Athens,Greece) by following three implementation approaches. The paper contributes in presenting aspects of designing systems that exploit the proposed smart exhibit concept to provide haptic access to cultural heritage thesaurus.}

Smart island is defined as insular territory with the ability to implement integrated solutions to the management of infrastructures and natural resources. The distributed optimization is accomplished by using primal-dual method of multipliers which has shown more promising performance in terms of execution time and convergence rate compared to the alternating-direction method of multipliers. The proposed energy management scheme is carried out between 5 different agents including an energy hub, a networked multi-microgrid with 3 agents and a transportation system. The transportation system comprises of the subway system and plug-in electric vehicles. The proposed networked multi-microgrid is made up of 3 microgrid systems, each one comprises of wind generation units, photovoltaic units and a tidal unit. Despite the assumption that the agents are both suppliers and consumers of energy and are completely operated and separated from the other sections, they share energy through a peer-to-peer energy trading. Such sharing scheme will be ended up by obtaining an equilibrium point through which a consensus is reached and all the parties are satisfied. Results prove the validity of the proposed approach in providing a proper energy negotiation framework in a smart island in terms of accuracy and applicability.}

Listed companies assume the responsibility to submit annual reports to disclose their ESG outcomes genuinely. However, the challenge is that companies may overstate or slur their actual sustainable performance, and the entire ESG reporting process is hidden backward, thereby making the report untrustworthy. Accordingly, this paper proposes an architecture of smart ESG reporting platform leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to enable corporate crowdsensing for environmental data and enhance the security, transparency and creditability of ESG reporting process. In addition, with the aim of motivating firms to upload massive ESG raw data of high quality, we devise an incentive mechanism that grants them crypto tokens as a reputation for sustainable performance disclosure, exposed to industry and investors for reference. The maximum tokens settlement for each environmental key performance indicator (KPI) is regarded as a cooperative game for premiums, and Shapley value is applied to fairly distribute the tokens in line with the disclosure significance scored by experienced investors. Here, we take the ESG reporting guide issued by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX) and the practice in the Hong Kong apparel industry as the context. An experimental simulation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform architecture and approach of token allocation. This study holds the promise of providing a precedent for adopting the advanced technologies to address the greenwashing in firms and actualize intelligent and trustable ESG reporting.}

In terms of methods, scientific literature selection criteria are derived from previous research and are focused on limitations and bottlenecks to the achievement of innovative business models, which are motivated, at their very basics, by energy, emission and cost savings. Additionally, besides these potential savings, smart energy services and technologies can provide multiple additional benefits such as improved Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and energy flexibility on the demand side, with respect to energy infrastructures. First, the research identifies the key elements that are necessary to integrate and to streamline techno-economic analysis and energy modelling processes. After that, it highlights potential advances in the broad area of energy transitions and decarbonisation of the built environment that can be achieved as an evolution of current practices and processes. Finally, it envisions the creation of “eco-systems” of interacting models for the building sector that share common underlying principles.}

This paper outlines the scope of threats which are posed by the hacking of Smart Devices and how these risks can now be physical in nature. The paper then proposes a novel methodology to apportion liability to either the manufacturer or the user, where appropriate. This methodology is based on the principle of negligence, although consumer rights and products liability are also examined from both an American and European perspective. Finally, legislative and judicial shortcomings in relation establishing liability are identified and remedies are proposed, with the intention of establishing a solid legal basis and treatment for cybersecurity.}

However, these factors are not directly controllable by building operations, and instead are a by-product of complex interactions between controllable parameters such as air conditioning setpoint and other environmental conditions. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to bridge the gap between controllable building parameters and thermal comfort, by conducting an extensive study on the efficacy of different ML techniques for modeling comfort levels. We show that neural networks are especially effective, and achieve 98.7% accuracy on average. We also show these networks can lead to linear models where thermal comfort score scales linearly with the HVAC setpoint, and that the linear models can be used to quickly and accurately find the optimal setpoint for the desired comfort level.}

Over the past decade, many datasets have been introduced to enable researchers to compare different localisation techniques. Existing datasets, however, have failed to cover open areas such as parks in cases where GPS is still unavailable, and there is a lack of Wifi access points. Also, the existing datasets only focus on getting Wifi fingerprint collected and labelled by users. To the best of our knowledge, no dataset provides Received Signal Strengths (RSS) collected by Wireless Access Points (APs). In this work, we offer two datasets publicly. The first is the Fingerprint dataset in which four users generated 16,032 accurate and consistently labelled WiFi fingerprints for all available Reference Points (RPs) in a central and busy area of Murdoch University, known as Bush Court. The second is the APs dataset that includes 2,450,865 auto-generated records received from 1000 users’ devices, including the four users, associated with Wifi signal strengths. To overcome the Wifi coverage problem for the Bush Court, we attached our previously designed Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) to existing garbage bins, enabling them to provide real-time environmental sensing and act as soft APs that sense MAC addresses and Wifi signals from surrounding devices.}

However, since effective and scalable methods for large-scale systems are currently unavailable, the implementation of smart controllers can be challenging and time-consuming. This is addressed herein by proposing a novel approach to include the thermal capacity of the connected buildings in the optimal control of large-scale heating networks. A reduced-order model of the aggregated communities supplied by a large-scale network is used to define their State of Charge, which is exploited to store or retrieve energy when convenient, while maintaining indoor comfort. This concept is included in a Model Predictive Controller that optimizes power plant management and heat distribution. The results show that the controller successfully shaves heat supply peaks to different regions up to 16% and reduces the difference between distribution and soil temperature up to 20%. At the same time, the return temperature is kept close to the set-point of 35 °C, which is lower than the historical operation and further reduces distribution heat losses. The procedure can be easily replicated to optimize systems of different sizes and to support their transition to efficient, smart district heating networks.}

Bold claims are made by industry and government that smart measurement devices will enable a new class of responsibilizing subjects who can be nudged and incentivized to orchestrate efficient low carbon energy governance. The carbon governmentality literature reveals the microphysics of power involved in responsibilization-as-governance. However, it insufficiently explains how the individualization of responsibility is shaped by and coexists with other sectoral and policy priorities, and political-economic imperatives. I show how the obdurate political-economic relations of the Australian electricity sector shape what can be measured, who can do the measuring, and who can access the metrics from smart meters. Utopian promises to govern for all by metrics are constrained by industry accumulation strategies, weak regulation and the embedded inequalities of infrastructural projects. I then show how responsibilization is being eclipsed by responsiveness as the new regime of accountability. Responsiveness bypasses active individual consumer decision-making, in favour of technologically-mediated automated processes. I show how responsiveness regimes are being driven by new whole-of-economy accumulation opportunities and enabled through the creation of a weakly-regulated sectoral market for electricity consumption data. Metering is a crucial but insufficient condition for the larger assemblage of responsiveness that involves data mobility through third party access, new forms of market competition, and value creation in demand response.}

Smart home energy management systems hold promise for shifting usage to match generation, but these systems need to be designed with the occupants’ preferences in mind. The purpose of the present research is to compare two approaches for collecting and modeling consumers’ load management preferences, both of which are amenable to use in a home energy management system. Specifically, we examine the performance of Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique Exploiting Ranks (SMARTER) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in quantifying consumers’ preferences regarding air temperature (air conditioning and heating), water heating, dishwashing, clothes washing and drying, monetary costs, environmental impacts, and comfort/convenience. Two studies are presented: Study 1 examines the SMARTER approach, and Study 2 focuses on the AHP approach. In both studies, online surveys (NSMARTER = 956 and NAHP = 1023) were conducted to elicit preferences from participants across the United States. The preferences modeled by both approaches were validated based on (a) their ability to predict participants’ choices in a Discrete Choice Experiment and (b) their convergence with previous research on load-shifting behavior. The validation procedure suggests that the SMARTER approach is superior in modeling consumers’ preferences for load management. This research lays the groundwork for designing a smart home interface capable of collecting occupants’ preferences and using those preferences to deliver improved occupant comfort, lower operating costs, reduced environmental impact, and more significant demand response than exists today.}

At aggregated level, the large EV charging loads, if not well regulated, will cause great stress on the existing grid infrastructures. On the other hand, considered as a resource-efficient and cost-effective demand response resource, EV fleet smart charging control methods have been developed and applied to mitigate power issues of the grid while avoiding expensive upgrade of power grid infrastructure. Until now, there is no systematic study on how different coordination mechanisms affecting the EV fleet's charging demand response performance. Thus, it is still unclear which one may perform better in the increasingly common solar-powered building communities, especially as demand response is increasingly concerned. Aiming to fill in such knowledge gaps, this study conducted systematic comparative studies of three representative control methods selected from the non-coordinated, bottom-up coordinated, and top-down coordinated control categories. Their power regulation performances have been comparatively investigated in two perspectives: minimizing peak power exchanges with the grid and maximizing PV self-utilization, based on a real building community in Sweden. Meanwhile, their computational performances have also been investigated. The study results show that due to the ability to schedule and coordinate all the EVs simultaneously, the top-down coordinated control is superior to the other two control methods in the considered demand response performances. Note that its better performance is realized with a higher computational load, leading to possible convergence difficulties in practice. The study results will help improve understanding of how coordination affect the EV smart charging control performances. It will pave the way for developments of more sophisticated control methods for EV smart charging in more complex scenarios.}

Although extensive literature has examined the travel patterns of older adults, very limited efforts have been invested to explore the longitudinal variability in public transport usage by different age groups of older adults. To address this limitation, we developed user-monthly profiles to explore the seasonal variability in public transport usage by older adults and defined user-based time slots of the day and geographical user areas to represent daily trip patterns and examine day-to-day variability. Using one-year smart card transaction data and an anonymous cardholder database from Shizuoka, Japan, we evaluated the seasonal and day-to-day variability in public transport usage by older adults. We also analyzed the role of age and living environment in travel pattern variability. The results indicate that older adults in highly developed areas and younger-old group (aged 65–74) are more likely to be characterized by high-frequency public transport usage and low seasonal variability. Additionally, the day-to-day variability in public transport usage by older adults is greater in more developed areas and appears to increase with age. This study enhances our understanding of public transport usage by older adults, which may contribute to the development of senior-friendly public transport policies and services.}

The traditional power grids or thermal-cooling and heating conversion systems converge to the use of smart grids and to the planning of intelligent local organizations through energy integration techniques. This cannot be assessed as an isolated problem but an integrated one. The right construction of smart society is to match different challenges achieving sustainable energy systems not only from the point of view of energy consumption in different sectors (civil, industrial, agriculture, transport) and of the related of pollutants emissions, but considering simultaneously the relation with the socio-economic impact. The aim of this paper is firstly to examine the theories-approach to smart energy systems at the community level, the scientific literature of the smart energy community, the benefits of their potential applications in the smart energy municipalities. Finally, it manages the aspects related to smart energy community adoption with a multidisciplinary approach linking the technical conditions to the socio-economic systems of territorial planning. The main finding is that the concept of the intelligent energy community is strictly related to a coherent and intersectoral approach searching the best control strategy to satisfy all energy requirements. Moreover, the road leading to the smart energy community is essential to build the more sustainable renewable energy systems, to collect storage synergies between energy sub-sectors through the energy sharing and finally to exploit economically efficient sources.}

Recent decades have seen policies and projects aiming at decentralizing urban structure and job-worker patterns, such as subway network expansion, the suburbanization of housing and firms. But it is unclear whether these changes produced a more balanced spatial configuration of jobs and workers. To answer this question, this paper evaluated the ratio of jobs to workers from Smart Card Data at the transit station level and offered a longitudinal study for regular transit commuters. The method identifies the most preferred station around each commuter's workpalce and home location from individual smart datasets according to their travel regularity, then the amounts of jobs and workers around each station are estimated. A year-to-year evolution of job to worker ratios at the station level is conducted. We classify general cases of steepening and flattening job-worker dynamics, and they can be used in the study of other cities. The paper finds that (1) only temporary balance appears around a few stations; (2) job-worker ratios tend to be steepening rather than flattening, influencing commute patterns; (3) the polycentric configuration of Beijing can be seen from the spatial pattern of job centers identified.}

It is evident that health-related pandemics have a detrimental and direct influence on the concept of the smart city. This is manifested through various social, economic, environmental, technological and energy-related changes. The overall electricity demand of the province for the month of April of this year amidst pandemic conditions declined by 14%, totaling 1267 GW. A unique trend of reciprocating energy demand exists throughout the week. The post-COVID-19 indicates higher energy demand in the earlier part of the week and a lower demand in the latter part of the week. Pre-pandemic, the days of highest electricity demand were in the latter part of the work week (Wed-Fri) in addition to the weekend. Post-pandemic, the highest electricity demand occurred in the earlier part of the week (Mon-Tue). Hourly electricity demand shows a clear curve flattening during the pandemic, especially during peak hours of 7–11 in the morning and 5–7 in the evening, resulting in significant demand reductions during these periods. Lastly, due to COVID-19, GHG emission reductions of 40,000 tonnes of CO2e were achieved along with savings of $131,844 for the month of April.}

Moreover, the RBAs could be used as colorimetric indicators to detect food spoilage because they are sensitive to changes in pH and ammonia gas production. The RBA-halochromic indicator changed from reddish/crimson → pink → yellow with increasing pH, and from pink → yellow with increasing ammonia vapor concentration. Furthermore, the smart films possessed good antioxidant and antimicrobial activity owing to the presence of the RBAs and CNFs.

The work's novelty lies in adopting several successful methods of various countries for waste disposal and management. To incorporate or improve India'sIndia's same techniques and processes, we have to tackle the ever-increasing waste disposal problems and find economic and eco-friendly ways of waste management.}

Thus, the existence of platforms to manage participation in aggregation entities and services gains importance, as they help to monitor players’ energy resources, and make their management more intuitive. This paper proposes an upgrade to the platform CECOS, initially designed to manage energy communities and their members. With the upgrade, the platform manages the players and entities belonging to the smart grid. The new version of the platform is not limited to its original services, as it allows the registration of distributed services, such as demand response, or forecast, by service providers. Furthermore, it allows the participation in several aggregation entities simultaneously, and provides a mobility mechanism, to allow players to move among entities to achieve their goals. A case study was developed to evaluate the platform, considering different types of forecasts and demonstrating favourable outcomes in terms of the predictions’ error decrease.}

In recent years, smart and ecological urbanism and transformations into the new models of city making have become a global mainstream. These are models of the smart city, the eco-city, and the eco-megacity. The article proposes a conceptual approach to the formation of the eco-megacity as a qualitatively new phenomenon in the post-industrial economy. The prerequisites for the transformation of a megapolis into an eco-megacity have been analyzed. The key characteristics of the new phenomenon have been revealed. The role of collaboration as the main factor in increasing the efficiency of interaction processes between ecosystem actors and between ecosystems themselves has been presented. The relationship of the formed ecosystem approaches and the groups of actors during implementation of an institutional project in the megapolis have been determined. It allows for the transformation of a megapolis into an eco-megacity. The ant colony optimization algorithm for studying the symbiosis of socio-economic ecosystems in the megapolis has been proposed. The authors have attempted to contribute to the development of theoretical and methodological aspects of the emerging eco-megacity concept as a new phenomenon of the modern economy.}

abstract = {Smart grid technologies have the potential to overcome several environmental, social, and technical problems associated with the current electricity production and consumption modes. However, the adoption of smart grids requires a change in users’ behavior. This study investigates the individual-level motivational factors that affect the intention to adopt “smart consumption and production behaviors”. Understanding these factors is important for implementing effective behavioral change initiatives that would facilitate the diffusion of smart grids. Ajzen's theory of planned behavior is applied to explain the formation of such an adoption intention. With a questionnaire survey distributed to a random sample of consumers, an elicitation study is conducted to obtain salient modal beliefs. Data collected from the main survey are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Consistent with the theory, the results of the structural equation analysis reveals that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control positively affect the adoption intention. Specifically, the study finds that the variable with the highest estimated loading factor perceived behavioral control, and the most important belief linked with attitude is energy savings. Further investigation indicates that the added exogenous variable, resistance to change, has a negative influence on intention. Results confirm the explanatory power of the theoretical model and provide valuable knowledge for individuals and institutions interested in facilitating the diffusion of smart grids via the implementation of behavioral change initiatives.}

A hurdle to their deployment is a lack of understanding about the compatibility requirements for resilient hardware. This book chapter presents optimal power flow (OPF) and a compatibility study of major hardware components’ boosting of network resilience, viz. twisted eye link and suspension clippers except for jumper cable clamps, terminating helices, a complete set of tension fittings with a set of suspension fittings and vibration damper, tension/dead-end assembly, etc. The application feasibility of all hardware is evaluated using the finite element analysis (FEA) tools of CATIA V5 (Cozzens, 2013). In this work, various approaches of SG security are also discussed. Furthermore, this knowledge could be applied to optimize the project cost of communication networking for any SG. The large power generators have complex connections to the transmission network, while distribution systems with their simplified topology have facilitated easy connection for many consumers. The generating companies look for optimum utilization of available power to serve consumer loads. However, distribution companies and consumers are always looking for a reliable supply at a comparatively cheaper rate. Moreover, transmission companies are lean to ensure healthy operations by reducing transmission line congestion, maintaining the lowest operating voltage, and minimizing corresponding line losses. These are considered in the OPF problems of power systems. In this regard, a supervised algorithm, namely collective animal behavior (CAB), is applied on the modified IEEE 30-bus test system to solve OPF problems in the power system. To find a solution for OPF issues intended to comply with undertaken objectives, viz. by fuel cost minimization and reductions in transmission line losses by the tuning of respective control variables.}

In order to elaborate guidelines for the Italian NECP improvement, a methodology based on the Smart Energy Systems (SES) approach has been proposed. The reference scenario has been modelled in EnergyPLAN. A Sectors’ Implementation Matrix, consisting of eight sectors and three implementation levels, has been developed and the configurations have been simulated by means of MAT4EnergyPLAN. The best scenario accomplishes the 55% emissions reduction targets along with a lowering in the annualised costs of Italian energy system. The RES capacity targets must be increased by further 33 GW for PV and 16.6 GW for WIND. High end-uses electrification degree represents the priority in the next decade, so as to easily and cost-effectively integrate the variable-RES. An integrated energy system and the sector coupling even take priority over the RES installation in order to minimise the energy system decarbonisation costs. Finally, the present work contributes to demonstrate the need for the SES approach in the planning of energy systems with large-scale RES integration.}

abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of central nervous system causing numerous symptoms. These symptoms include decreased or absent proprioceptive sensation, due to involvement of deep sensory system and spinocerebellar tract, that affects normal gait, and postural stability resulting in repetitive falls. The theory was that, the perception of pressure sensation by the plantar surface, in patients with impaired deep sensation, can be conveyed to another area with intact deep sensation perception via a specialized designed device; a method of posterior column/spinocerebellar tract injury compensation via bypassing the functionally impaired segment. This study presents the design, implementation and validation of a prototype for a smart assistive device which substitutes the lack of plantar pressure sensation by stimulating the patient's back muscles proprioceptors.
Material(s) and Method(s)
In this pilot study five patients with MS (pwMS) having deep sensory impairment of lower limbs, motor power >=4, intact trunk and upper limbs, cerebellar functional system score of <=2 and EDSS 3-5 were included together with two normal control subjects. The proposed device is composed of two compact shoe insoles. Each has six embedded force sensing resistors (FSR) to measure plantar pressure, and a wireless transmitter. When the patient walks, the dynamic plantar pressure is transmitted wirelessly to the belt around the trunk. The belt houses two arrays of six small micro-vibrating motors corresponding to the location of the six sensors located in each insole. The receiver module in the belt initiates the micro-vibrators in a pattern that mirrors exactly the plantar pressure recorded from the insoles. Thus, the back of the patient receives real time feedback. Two types of experimental evaluation were conducted: quantitative balance assessment and quantitative gait assessment.
Result(s)
The results showed that there was an improvement of PwMS balance while using the smart assistive device during different postures of quiet stance. In addition, the results of the case study participating in gait assessment showed an improvement of gait kinematic parameters after rehabilitation with the device for one week.
Conclusion(s)
We developed an assistive device that can help to solve the balance problems suffered by some pwMS having deep sensory affection. Still, the device has to be further upgraded to be more user friendly.}

The actor-network theory (ANT), established by Latour, is a theory that provides a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of smart cities by illustrating how the networks of human and non-human actors create the weave of unpredictable connections. We call this digital serendipity when it is realized as a service from this network. This study aims to analyze the actor-network, where digital serendipity can occur, and apply it to increase the possibility of service formation. To this end, we collect the location data of users on a campus as a living lab and analyze the network between users and buildings. Further, by applying the results of the analyzed network, we develop a web-based application as an example where digital serendipity can be implemented for voluntary service formation. To verify the service connectivity, we conducted a test utilizing library book rental data.}

This study focused on a method for realizing low-cost and flexible PV power generation for urban slums with competitive business models. First, an analysis of rooftop PV in slums revealed three business models as dominant including slums, high-rise buildings, governments, power systems, and energy service providers. Afterward, considering Shenzhen as a case study, different loads of various buildings were provided, and the overall power generation potential at the city level was analyzed. Subsequently, 11 typical building groups were selected to evaluate the business model profits. Consequently, considering the construction rate caused by the energy policy of PVs, the most suitable solutions for different types of areas and various construction-rate combinations were discussed. Thus, this study argued that our novel analysis could serve as a powerful tool for policymakers to plan the future development of sustainable cities and alleviate poverty.}

With five-year (from 2016 to 2020) SBBS smart card data collected in Nanjing, China, a longitudinal analysis is performed in this study to trace yearly dynamics of commuter behaviors at an individual level. We identify two sorts of SBBS commuters (i.e., SBBS-alone and SBBS-metro commuters) based on users’ spatial-temporal travel regularities. The paper finds that (i) the number of SBBS users presented a considerable fluctuation trend over a five-year span, while the proportion of SBBS commuters stabilized at an equilibrium level; (ii) the COVID-19 outbreak accelerated the decline in the proportion of female and young SBBS commuters; (iii) most SBBS commuters were recorded for only one year out of five, while the share of commuters who used SBBS for four years or more is tiny, <5%; (iv) the trip duration of SBBS-alone commuters was significantly longer than that of SBBS-metro commuters, and both showed some increase during the COVID-19 pandemic; (v) the number of non-loop trip chains was dramatically higher than that of loop trip chains, which is more prominent among SBBS-metro commuters. Our findings could provide valuable insights into the behavioral dynamics of SBBS commuters and offer recommendations on how policy makers and transportation planners could respond to these precipitate changes.}

Unreliable waiting times may cause frustration and anxiety amongst public transport travellers. Although the effect of travel time reliability has been studied extensively, most studies have used stated preferences which have disadvantages, such as an inherent hypothetical bias, or have analysed revealed preferences for road traffic. Here, we derive revealed preferences from passively collected smart card data to analyse the role of waiting time reliability in public transport route choice. We study waiting time reliability as regular and irregular deviations from scheduled values, examining a number of indicators for the latter. Behaviour in morning peak and off-peak hours is contrasted and differences in reliability coefficients for different modes in the network, and for origin and transfer stops are reported. Results from The Hague indicate relatively low reliability ratios with travellers perceiving a 5-minute standard deviation in realised waiting times as an extra 1–5.6 min of planned waiting time.}

The smart mobility options include shared taxi, one-way car rental, and a novel combination of park-and-ride and school bus facilities. While previous surveys on smart mobility options had investigated limited number of alternatives in isolation, the SP survey used in this research presents the smart mobility options alongside the existing options and their traditional variants like congestion pricing and improved public transport systems. Further, the choice of mode, departure time and occupancy are investigated in a multidimensional framework. This resulted a large choice set (with 9 modes, 5 departure times, and 2 occupancy levels leading to 135 alternatives in total) and required a novel survey design. The main survey administered over the internet and computer aided personal interviews included 2372 valid SP observations from 1248 respondents. Multi-dimensional mixed logit models were used to capture the complex correlations introduced due to the non-traditional survey design. Results indicate a significant preference of one-way car rental and shared taxi for non-commute trips. For commute trips, improved versions of traditional public transport modes are favoured over smart mobility options. These findings, as well as the novel data collection and modelling approach, are expected to provide important information to transportation planners and policy makers working to implement smart mobility options in Lisbon as well as in other cities.}

abstract = {India is developing fast in the lines of some of the greatest cities of the world. Graph from the last 20-25 years show that India has majorly borne a paradigm shift in development icons as such Its cities have surpassed even double to its initial infrastructure during this period. Most of these infrastructural icons have a lot to do with the IT industry boom in the country as such most of these cities (e.g. Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Hyderabad etc.) are further burdened with employable youth, who require transit accommodation in the same city as well. There are some other cities too who used to enjoy the tourist or the pilgrims’ inflow by virtue of some kind of religious, natural or heritage resource attached to it. But, as evident in History, India and the Indians are known to be cultural driven, Pilgrimage friendly people. As such, these Blessings to such cities are continuously turning out to be the sufferings in the light of the number of pilgrims/tourists (floating population) these cities bear on daily basis. Most of these cities lack the sustainable infrastructure to uphold these burdens and to meet the energy demands for the well-being of people and city. These infrastructural additions must contemplate the Energy demands of the built form, people and their activities. One of such vulnerable town due to Paradigm shift in its development priorities is KATRA town, which is continuously getting burdened with more and more buildings, people & loss of Rural Greens as such contemplation of energy requirements is the need of the hour. Katra town is world famous for the rich religious history attached to it as it forms the base town (Camp) of Trikuta Hills upon which (12 kms away from base town) the Holy Shrine of Goddess Maa Vaishno Devi is located. Every year millions of Pilgrims from around the globe visit the shrine & the Katra Town. The Katra town is the major contributor of J&K (Jammu & Kashmir State) economy & India at Large. Pertinently, its being projected as one of the smart cities of India in next few years in the lines of leading smart cities of the world.}

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing can complement other energy management strategies needed in the energy transition to clean energy such as renewables. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things can provide cutting-edge solutions to dynamic information interaction and power exchange, enabling efficient P2P energy sharing and trading schemes. However, the current electricity market fails to comprehensively consider devices degradation costs and transmission losses, fairness distribution and allocation on cost-benefit model, synergistic collaborations and operations for different stakeholders. Here, a comprehensive review on P2P energy sharing and trading is presented covering novel system configurations, energy sharing and marginal/trading price mechanisms, and decision-making in dynamic P2P energy trading combined with synergistic collaboration and operation among key stakeholders. Significances of this review include comprehensive consideration on internal trading pricing, fairness distribution and allocation with active participation in P2P energy sharing, synergistic collaborations and operations with mutual economic benefits. Modelling tools for P2P energy trading platforms for real applications are also reviewed. The review shows that P2P when optimally designed can provide win-win economic benefits to all related stakeholders such as prosumers, consumers, retailers, and aggregators with fair access to distributed energy resources. The P2P energy sharing can improve the system efficiency, reduce energy storage capacity and primary energy consumption, improve renewable penetration, avoid energy quality devaluation and mitigate stressed grid power together with voltage support and congestion management for the local power grid. Employing blockchain technology improves the automation level in P2P thus decreasing human interactions improving the security with transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems, and accelerating real-time settlements with smart contracts. Synergistic collaboration and operation among stakeholders can ensure economic benefits for each participant, fair energy distribution and cost allocation, and decrease reliance on retailers or aggregators. The results presented provide cutting-edge guidelines for increasing the use and acceptance of smart and fair P2P energy sharing and trading frameworks.}

With the increasing need to enable people to age in place independently, the availability of such data is key to the development of home monitoring solutions. In this article we describe an unlabelled dataset of measurements collected from multiple environmental sensors placed in a smart home to capture human activities of daily living. Various sensors were used including passive infrared, force sensing resistors, reed switches, mini photocell light sensors, temperature and humidity, and smart plugs. The sensors record data from the user’s interactions with the environment, such as indoor movements, pressure applied on the bed, or current consumption when using electrical appliances. Millions of raw sensor data samples were collected continuously at a frequency of 1 Hz over a period of six months between 26 February 2020 and 26 August 2020. The dataset can be useful in the analysis of different methods, including data-driven algorithms for activity or habit recognition. In particular, the research community might be interested in investigating the performance of algorithms when applied on unlabelled datasets and not necessarily on annotated datasets. Furthermore, by applying artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on such data collected over long periods, it is possible to extract patterns that reveal the user’s habits as well as detect changes in the habits. This can benefit in detecting deviations in order to provide timely interventions for patients, e.g., people with dementia.}

However, every query for information issued from a smart home could adversely affect the privacy of its inhabitants. Since every Electronic Product Code assigned to RFID-equipped objects is unique, it is easily possible to create detailed and long-term customer profiles by linking queries on particular items to a specific person. In order to address the privacy problem, this paper proposes a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for organized sharing and private querying of data, which is formed by many smart devices across several homes. The efficiency of this approach is examined with experiments involving several hundred nodes. Furthermore, larger peer-to-peer networks of smart home appliances are simulated. According to our evaluation, the proposed solution is able to satisfy real-time requirements in settings where smart devices are geographically close. Moreover, the architecture can be used to store information of nearly one million different products within a network of one thousand nodes, which is a reasonable size for a local collaborative infrastructure between smart homes in towns or cities.}

Smartwatch will thus contribute to improving the quality of work performed among professional drivers by minimizing the risk of stress, falling asleep or dehydration, which in the past led to accidents and road collisions. The aim of the article is to present the potential of smartwatches in transport companies in Poland. The gradual introduction of smartwatches in companies and the popularization of smartwatches among professional drivers raises the question: Will the introduction of smartwatches in transport companies that enable monitoring of fitness and health improve the safety, efficiency and quality of work of professional drivers? The survey was conducted in 2012-2022 among non-financial companies, including companies from the TSL industry (small and medium-sized enterprises). The survey showed that Polish entrepreneurs are willing to equip their employees with mobile devices.

One of these missing attributes is the trip purpose attribute. This paper proposes a novel method to infer the trip purpose attribute from the sequences of trips of passengers instead of separate trips. The proposed method infers the trip purpose attribute (a missing attribute in the smart card data) from the temporal attributes (available attributes in the smart card data). First, the relation between the temporal attributes and the trip purpose attribute is learnt by discovering clusters of passengers in the Household Travel Survey dataset while each passenger is represented by one sequence of trips. Then, the discovered clusters are utilized to infer the trip purpose of smart card transactions by allocating each passenger to the closest clusters. The proposed method is implemented on the smart card and HTS datasets from southeast Queensland, Australia. The evaluation results showed a considerable improvement in inferring the trip purpose compared to the results published in the literature. Notably, the effect of considering the trip sequence was more significant than considering land use variables.}

This new scenario enables a completely new perspective of applications that lead to a path of general improvement of grid performance, in which the participation of plug-in electric vehicles has great importance. In this view, this work proposes a comprehensive operation strategy of plug-in electric vehicles for unbalanced smart microgrid environments. The first contribution is the grid-to-vehicle strategy based on buses availability of power whose primary objective is the maintenance of satisfactory operating conditions for the grid while controlling the plug-in electric vehicles charging. The second contribution relates to a holistic vehicle-to-grid coordinated approach, which is triggered in the event of microgrid islanding. The goal, in this case, is to assist the network by using the plug-in electric vehicles available stored energy. At last, the main contribution is obtained by the combination of both methodologies providing a comprehensive operation of plug-in electric vehicles for smart microgrids environments. The proposed method is designed for general three-phase unbalanced distribution systems with a wide range of resources and present versatility in the communication requirements. For validation, simulations are performed in a comprehensive unbalanced three-phase distribution system considering different disruptive scenarios faced by microgrids. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is satisfactory and ensure the operation of the microgrid within acceptable limits in both connected and islanded situations.}

Therefore, this paper presents a Machine Learning-based attack detection approach to identify the attack traffic in Consumer IoT (CIoT). This approach operates on local IoT network-specific attributes to empower low-cost machine learning classifiers to detect attack, at the local router. The experimental outcomes unveiled that the proposed approach achieved the highest accuracy of 0.99 which confirms that it is robust and reliable in IoT networks.}

abstract = {Advances in technology and population growth are two factors responsible for increasing electricity consumption, which directly increases the production of electrical energy. Also, due to environmental, technical and economic constraints, it is challenging to meet the demand at certain hours, such as peak hours. Therefore, it is necessary to manage the network consumption to modify the peak load and complete the power system constraints. One way to achieve this goal is to use a demand response program. The best infrastructure for running these types of programs is the smart grid (SG). This paper first considers many shiftable loads of different kinds in the SG, including residential, commercial, and industrial microgrids. The load shift method is, then, modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem to manage the shiftable load consumption of the SG. The main goals of this problem include reducing the cost of customer bills, the peak load, losses and improving network voltage. Simulations are performed by two methods of Simplex and Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO). The Simplex method is implemented with the CPLEX solver in General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software and the IGWO algorithm is implemented in MATLAB software. Then, the effect of implementing the proposed program with both methods is examined and compared. For example, in terms of reducing the peak load, the CPLEX method could reduce the peak in the residential, commercial, and industrial microgrids by 6.7%, 1%, and 16% more than IGWO, respectively. CPLEX also can reduce the production costs of residential, commercial, and industrial microgrids by more than 3.5, 2.2, and 3.9% compared to IGWO. In general, the CPLEX solver provides better results than the IGWO in many cases.}

In this paper, the focus is on power management strategies in a public smart charging park (SCP) characterized by renewables, storage systems, and different kinds of charging stations (CSs), both classical and V2G. EVs are supposed to be already allocated and present at the CSs. Power management aims to satisfy the demands of EVs without delays. Moreover, some reference values on the power purchased from the grid and the use of the storage are considered. The results show that the system is able to satisfy the energy request before the due date and the CSs with V2G are used to reduce the power purchased from the grid during the day.}

This system is able to move a phase change material layer with respect to the insulation layer inside the building component. With this ability, the system can increase solar benefits in winter and take profit from night free cooling in summer. During the heating season, the system places the phase change material facing outdoors during sunny hours to melt it, and it moves the phase change material back facing indoors to provide space heating when desired. In the cooling season, the phase change material is moved to the outer face of insulation at night time to enhance its solidification process, and it is moved back to face indoors during cooling peak hours. An appropriate control system, referring to the schedule of operation and placement of phase change material layer with respect to the insulation (when phase change material is facing outdoors or indoors) is critical to achieve savings and avoid malfunctioning of the system. In this work, we have developed and numerically compared two different control algorithms based on weather forecast data for space heating and cooling applications. Experimentation has been done under four different climate conditions: Athens, Madrid, Strasbourg, and Helsinki. One of the control algorithms, based on local search (Tabu), provided the set of activations of the dynamic system for a 24 h period. The other algorithm is based on model predictive control with an horizon of 2.5 and 5 h. Results proved the feasibility of the two smart control methods, as well as their capacity to improve the energy benefits of the dynamic phase change material system in days with suitable weather conditions. Moreover, the two control algorithms successfully avoided activating the system in days with non-appropriate weather conditions.}

abstract = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) recognized as an emerging technology that provides cloud computing services in the proximity of Radio Access Network (RAN). Mobile subscribers could offload their computation-intensive or memory-intensive tasks to the nearest Base Stations (BS) and deliver the cloud services from MEC servers. This technology can meet the requirements of low latency and location awareness. Smart map applications are an indispensable part of our digital life in large cities. In this paper, we introduce how the map application could gain from MEC technology. We concentrate on performance modeling and analysis of direction-finding in the map application. We study the impact of variation of workload, the number of servers, queue length, and connection failure on the task rejection probability and mean sojourn time. We model each phase of direction-finding service by the Markov Reward Model (MRM). The numerical results presented by applying models in the SHARPE software package. Furthermore, inter-dependencies between sub-models resolved by the fixed-point iteration technique. Moreover, the analytical results verified by the Discrete-Event Simulation (DES), which conducted in MATLAB. The result could help the MEC providers to assess their platform performance.}

Space technologies play a vital role in improving soil quality, reducing the waste of water during irrigation and sharing agricultural information with farmers. With the help of terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial sensors, satellites and surveillance equipment, a large volume of geo-spatial data from diversifying sources is collected, analyzed, and utilized for smart farming and shielding of crops. The technology foresight will introduce innovations such as the use of drones in agriculture, precision gene processing in plants, epigenetic, big data and internet of things (IoT), utilizing efficiently all types of energy like smart wind and solar energy, artificial intelligence-based application of robotics, desalination technology in mega-scale and so on. Some of these innovations are already being used in developed nations. Agriculture plays an important role in developing economy so the use of digital farming in rural areas will be a boon for agriculture sector. By 2030, 85% of the world's population is expected to live in developing countries. In this context, data-driven technological development is urgently needed for developing countries to increase gross domestic product (GDP) and ensure food security for the population.}

abstract = {Since the 1950s, African cities in a quest for modernity and prosperity have been urgently playing catch up to deal with the increasing demand for adequate urban systems and infrastructure. At the turn of the 21st century, many spatial planning models, technological trends, environmental challenges, and socio-economic realities are influencing African cities’ dynamics largely causing confusion and a lack of consistent planning policies. To efficiently guide a coherent and coordinated vision, frame an integrated long-term spatial logic, and give a precise direction for sustainable urban development, this paper aims to develop a localized and contextualised analysis of urban planning challenges and development strategies shaping African cities. The study provides a broad perspective looking at the potentiality of spatial planning practices to envision and transform urban life by prospecting integrated urban planning and development strategies to face increasing urban challenges in Africa. Through Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and machine-learning tools, the study brings, for the first time, consolidated and updated knowledge of urban planning practices in Africa. We analysed 243 urban studies, published between 2000 and 2023, in 107 African cities. We identified and scrutinised 17 most pressing urban challenges and 16 most applied urban strategies to address those challenges. Accordingly, the study’s findings suggest shifting the spatial planning paradigm towards urban resilience as an interoperable system of different spatial planning policies and their relevant urban development strategies. Furthermore, the study’s key arguments are to improve urban infrastructure and optimize existing cities to reverse environmental degradation and guide urban fast transformation to adapt and mitigate growing climate change catastrophes.}

Despite the proven benefits of utilizing IoT-based technologies, its integration in the healthcare sector is minimal, particularly in nursing care. The purpose of this study is to establish a conceptual model to guide program designers and implementation leaders in evaluating the adoption of IoT products and services in nursing care, from the perspective of nurses. The study employed an empirical quantitative research design utilizing a structured online questionnaire to collect data from a convenience sample of nursing staff gathered data were subjected to statistical analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Structural Equation Modeling Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). Data analysis led to the establishment of a framework to identify factors influencing the integration of IoT and barriers that may impede its adoption in nursing care. The study makes a valuable contribution to academia by addressing a gap in the existing literature relating to the adoption of IoT in medical services, particularly in nursing care, and providing a novel theoretical framework that encompasses effective factors for the integration of IoT in medical care. This model provides deep insight and guidance to healthcare industry leaders, system developers, and nursing professionals to improve program design and implementation of IoT applications in healthcare. In addition, the model guides building engineering in the planning and design of medical facilities aligned with the IoT technologies and its physical environment. Finally, the study paved the way for further research exploring the implementation of IoT-based technologies and expanding the model to other stakeholders and functions within medical departments as well as other industries.}

It is the future of the upcoming generation for smart city development. Operations and designing of smart systems for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices include various types of decision-making at different levels of domains. Highly complex systems have a huge number of variables and decision-making requirements which also needs real-time data gathering from IIoT devices. Fog computing performs a key role by locating IIoT devices close to its proximity and reducing the processing time in comparison to cloud computing for smart systems. It makes smart systems work in a secure, flexible and time-sensitive manner. The presence of sensors makes data-intensive analysis challenging in these systems but fog computing handles it all. Along with other challenges, security is also one of the concerns that can affect the overall system if compromised. The main objective of this article is to introduce hierarchical fog computing-based architecture for smart energy-supplying systems as a part of Industry 5.0. This architecture will be able to support a large number of infrastructural components and provide services efficiently. In this article, validation of the amount of data transmitted by IIoT devices to the cloud per second is done for three different cases: 1. The proposed four-layer fog computing architecture, 2. Fog architecture with only layer three layers with the rest of the computing on the cloud, 3. A traditional system with cloud computing. The proposed approach is validated over state of art approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the security of the architecture is provided using the Attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which ensures data confidentiality with minimum overhead.}

abstract = {Making the environment “smart” requires intelligent sensors which must be equipped with self-power supply systems that are sustainable and environmentally friendly but presents low maintenance cost. Photovoltaic modules demonstrate a remarkable energy harvesting technology that can meet up to most of the requirements of these sensors. Inside buildings, natural solar light is not available therefore if PV modules are used in buildings, they must function with artificial light. This piece of work consists of investigating the performances of available PV modules under artificial light sources. Four PV modules based on the monocrystalline; m-Si and polycrystalline; p-Si technologies (m-Si PV1, p-Si PV2, p-Si PV3 and m-Si PV4) are measured under four artificial light sources and at varying illumination levels from 100 lx to 2000 lx. The representation and analysis of the characteristics show that best performances were recorded for the module m-Si PV4 reaching power densities of up to 555.83 μW/cm2, 382.96 μW/cm2 and 1065.69μW/cm2 at 2000 lx under the incandescent lamp, lamp combination (LED, CFL, and Incandescent) and the halogen lamp respectively. On the other hand, worst performances of modules were observed under the LED lamp and the CFL with power densities ranging from only 0.16μW/cm2 at 100 lx recorded for p-Si PV3 to 23.63μW/cm 2 at 2000 lx recorded for m-Si PV4 and 0.22μW/cm 2 at 100 lx for p-Si PV3 to 27.37μW/cm2 at 2000 lx recorded for m-Si PV4 respectively for the LED lamp and CFL. The m-Si based PV modules therefore perform better than the p-Si based modules under artificial light.}

The higher hydrolysis ratio and the poorer rejection efficiencies of the membrane under thermophilic conditions, resulting that the permeate COD, carbohydrate and protein of the ThAnMBR was higher than that of the MeAnMBR. The lost COD that might be converted into biogas was discharged with the permeate in the ThAnMBR, which was partly responsible for the inconspicuous methanogenic performance. Furthermore, the results of energy recovery potential assessment showed that the energy return on investment (EROI) of the MeAnMBR was 4.54, 3.81, 2.69 and 2.22 at the four SeS ratios, which was higher than that of the ThAnMBR at 3.29, 2.97, 2.02 and 1.80, respectively, indicating the advantage of the MeAnMBR over the ThAnMBR in energy recovery potential. The outcomes of this study will help to choose a more favorable temperature to co-digest SeS and FW to support the construction of smart cities.}

The results of visual analysis of research hotspots show the research in the field of renewable energy during pandemics is divided into two categories: “opportunities” and “crisis”, and further obtained five categories: sustainable development, environmental management, carbon emission, solar photovoltaic power, and wind power. The results of the keyword evolution map indicate the two main directions of renewable energy research in the post-pandemic: (1) Clean energy investment has become an important measure to revitalize the economy after the epidemic. (2) Energy efficiency research will effectively promote the sustainable development of renewable energy. Finally, we put forward policy suggestions on how to build a smart energy system in the post-epidemic era.}

MXene (Ti3C2Tx), which is a new two-dimensional material with remarkable properties, has been widely applied in wearable electronics. However, it remains a challenge to prepare MXene based smart textile that possesses multifunctional wearable sensing applications and can also keep MXene from oxidizing. Here, we fabricated a waterproof and breathable smart textile by construction of a multiple core–shell structure, i.e., MXene decoration onto the polydopamine (PDA) modified elastic textile followed by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating. MXene wrapping the fibers formed the conductive network, while PDMS could not only protect the MXene from oxidation but also endow the textile with superhydrophobicity and thus corrosion resistance. The smart textile possessed outstanding and durable photo-thermal and electro-thermal conversion performance. More importantly, the textile electronic exhibited sensitive and stable strain sensing performance and temperature sensing capacity with a high thermal coefficient of resistance. Evidently, such smart textile device is highly promising for application in next generation all-in-one wearable electronics.}

Consequently, while being able to conceive efficient storage systems coupled with robust energy management strategies present significant interests, a number of related studies often consider the human behaviour factor separately. While not decisive in large industrial factories, human demeanor impact cannot be overlooked in residential areas. As such, this work proposes an innovative and flexible dynamic population model, inspired from epidemiological methods, that allows simulation of a vast spectrum of social scenarios. By pairing this formalization with a smart energy management strategy, a complete framework is proposed. In particular, beyond the theoretical identification of sustainable parameters in a wide diversity of configurations, our experiments demonstrate the relevance of reinforcement learning agents as efficient energy management policies. Depending on the scenario, the trained agent enables an increase of the sustainability areas over baseline strategies up to 200%, thus hinting at ultimately softer societal impact.}

Online platforms provide some advantages to consumers such as product variety, deals on prices and mitigate geographical barriers. Nevertheless, existing auction platforms are centralized and depend on third-party intermediaries for transaction settlement. As a result, online platforms raise critical concerns regarding data integrity, security, transparency, and traceability as potential bidders have to trust the organizer for legitimacy of bids. Thus, adopting a decentralized approach using blockchain technology can transform the auction process, eliminating intermediaries, ensure transparency and reduce transaction costs. In this paper, we propose a general framework for decentralized auctions leveraging (i) Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track bids, (ii) decentralized storage systems to upload documents related to bidding and (iii) trusted timer oracles that act as gateway between smart contract and external data feeds. In the proposed solution, we develop detailed algorithms that define the working principles of the Smart contract for the auction process. We present detailed cost analysis of the solution to demonstrate economic feasibility, providing a secure, transparent and reliable approach to online auctions.}

The analysis focusses on a) current actions undertaken by cities in achieving a circular economy and reducing/optimising waste streams, b) envisioned circular actions in supporting climate neutrality by 2030, and c) urban sectors and metabolic flows for which circularity has a particularly high potential to mitigate climate change. Best practices are captured to create an informative set of actions aimed at policy-makers and at encouraging peer-to-peer learning. Finally, the barriers to incrementing circular approaches that emerge from the cities’ self-assessments are compared to those identified in existing scientific literature to provide input for a more comprehensive conceptual framework. Overall, this study distils how circular economy imaginaries are translated into local governance and policy-making by focussing on a large group of cities. This is key to truly understand why some initiatives fail and others succeed and can inform all relevant stakeholders on the next steps to take.}

abstract = {The urban socioeconomic metabolism of multiple flows of resources is highly complex. Our concern is that of moderating the environmental burden and intensity of this metabolism and elevating its “circularity” through technological interventions in the composition of urban infrastructure. The paper addresses present and possible future patterns of the nitrogen (N) metabolism of Suzhou, China, using a Multi-sectoral Systems Analysis (MSA) model of the water, energy, food, forestry, and waste management sectors of the city's infrastructure and economy. Two of the Triple Bottom Lines are employed in the assessment: those of the economic feasibility and the environmental benignity of the technological interventions. Environmental benignity is gauged by three Metabolic Performance Metrics (MPMs). 15 scenarios of these interventions are assessed, each being a different combination of introducing four particular promising technologies. The MPMs allow ranking of the scenarios according to, first, the ratio of incoming resource flows into the city and outgoing socio-economically beneficial products and, second, the rates at which “wastes” of no value are released to the atmosphere (as air pollutants), hydrosphere (water pollutants), and the lithosphere (solid wastes). The economic feasibility of the options can similarly be ranked according to the monetary values of resources (such as clean water or energy) that are saved by lowered urban consumption or that are recovered (such as biofuels or fertilizer) for beneficial re-circulation and re-use. All four candidate technological innovations are associated with the water and waste management sectors of urban infrastructure. We show that the trio of urine-separating technology, cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment, and pyrolysis of animal manure can achieve an expected net annual economic benefit of 1.4B Yuan, together with the potential to recover some 31 Gg N yr−1. Notably, our computational assessment accounts for uncertainty, using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity testing. In particular, we examine how uncertainty may significantly undermine the conclusions we may draw about the promise of any given technological innovation vis à vis another alternative.}

In 2014, roughly 54 percent of the world's populations live in urban areas, and the numbers are expected to go up to 70 percent by 2050. A smart grid is considered as one energy approach to address the increasing demand for sustainable energy. Currently, the U.S. is accelerating the smart grid movement and efforts to modernize the electric grid. The authors will provide an overview of the electricity industry evolution and the emergence of smart grid. Most researchers tend to focus on the physical infrastructure and information layer of the smart grid. However, the most important aspect, which is the social aspect that fuels the advancement of any technology, is often neglected or forgotten. Customer interaction with the utility service provider is arguably one of the key factors of a successful smart grid. But, customers are considered as end users and are often the last in the communication chain to find out about changes in the energy service system, including the ongoing implementation of the smart grid. This paper presents a case study on the State of New York's latest ambitious efforts in reforming the energy vision and their strategies to be proactive in actively engaging customers in the ongoing development of the smart grid. The authors explore the customer-centricity in a smart grid and their interactions using a formalized object oriented modeling approach to reason about the problem, understand the complexity of the evolving energy service system, and communicate about the smart grid with others1.}

The proposed fuzzy architecture is used to optimize the construction of intelligent microgrids with storage networks, sustainability, and resource-regulated loads. The fuzzy framework improves electricity and storage to use renewables and optimizes the economic reward of the microgrid. The fuzzy framework uses sun power, wind speed, and power load as input parameters to allow power efficiency controllably and uncontrolled. Input factors such as sunlight, electrical efficiency, wind, and energy are used to manage electricity using uncontrollable and regulated loads. These input data may be directly measured, imported, or estimated using any prediction method by grid calculation. This article contains the input parameters, a range of rules, and the de-fuzzified output by the expert method. The results of the expert program are mentioned to understand how to manage microgrid energy consumption and production. The judgements on generated electricity, load demand, and own use are dependent on three outputs. The first generation is for the treatment, sale, or consumption of the generated energy. The secondary output is used to check the loading. The third finding demonstrates how manufacturing can be performed to use by consumers. The expert procedure by entering parameter values on an hourly basis has been evaluated. The proposed solution is finally contrasted with other accessible alternatives to validate the results.}

Accounting for such values is an important challenge in developing sustainable cities. Crowdsourcing methods, such as big data and smart phone applications, have emerged as promising methods to improve insights into subjective perceptions and preferences. However, we know little about how well these relatively new methods actually quantify subjective values. We assessed several of these new methods by comparing observations of use (n = 1009) to three crowdsourcing methods in one large park in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: a dedicated mobile app providing in situ stated preferences (n = 377), passive social media (n = 78) and a municipal reporting app (n = 187). We show that observed use and passive social media only captured user quantity and were not able to identify green space qualities that are important for mental health functions, such as how relaxing or safe a location is. The dedicated mobile app combined with observed use helped to identify priority locations for improvement. Our findings emphasize that if inadequate measures are used in smart city developments, subjective values and specific user groups will continue to be overlooked in planning processes.}

This paper proposes an ontology for the representation of the knowledge related to SMIs, with the aim of facilitating interoperability between SMIs as well as with other Musical Things interacting with them. There was no previous comprehensive data model for the SMIs domain, however the new ontology relates to existing ontologies, including the SOSA Ontology for the representation of sensors and actuators, the Audio Effects Ontology dealing with the description of digital audio effects, and the IoMusT Ontology for the representation Musical Things and IoMusT ecosystems. This paper documents the design of the ontology and its evaluation with respect to specific requirements gathered from an extensive literature review, which was based on scenarios involving SMIs stakeholders, such as performers and studio producers.

However, very few households in the UK—and perhaps even elsewhere—have actual experience with state-of-the-art smart heating systems that may utilize enhanced control or feedback. Drawing from a unique sample of actual adopters of smart heating, this study closely examines the heating preferences, practices, and profiles of homes when they are given smarter heating systems. The study utilizes qualitative household data from the Energy System Catapult’s Living Laboratory of 100 smart homes in Birmingham (West Midlands), Bridgend (Wales), Manchester (Greater Manchester), and Newcastle (Northumberland). We examine the heating preferences and profiles of participants, with findings inductively organized around the themes of temperature, including tradeoffs between comfort, cost, and value; time, including the utility of heat scheduling; and space, including zonal heating controls. We also discuss patterns of learning, the emergence of environmental values, and issues of discomfort. We conclude by commenting on important distinctions between radiant and ambient heat, as well as between scheduled and on-demand heat. The main findings are 1) tradeoffs between comfort, value and cost occur when it comes to smart heating; 2) people want different numbers of warm hours in their homes at very different times; 3) households chose to heat different numbers of rooms; and 4) there are other non-monetary and non-functional aspects of smart heating that households value.}

The charging process design needs to minimise the impact on the power grids, thus avoiding the cost and environmental impact of grid expansion. Especially, in urban, densely populated areas, efficient, intelligent charging solutions are a chance to prevent uncontrolled charging of a high number of vehicles and an amplification of existing load peaks. This study is based on the results of a project called URCHARGE (URban CHARGing), in which the largest field test to date in Austria investigated how to control the charging processes of BEVs in residential buildings. The core objective of this research is to investigate sustainable, future-proof charging infrastructure for residential buildings and to analyse and minimise the impact on the power grid towards almost 100% e-mobility in private passenger car transport. The dynamic charging control greatly reduces the power capacity required for BEV charging, successfully shifts the charging times and thus avoids grid peaks. Users hardly noticed these load shifts, and overall there was great satisfaction with the charging process.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate Saudi parents’ privacy concerns regarding their children’s smart device applications (apps). To this end, we conducted a survey and analysed 119 responses. Our results show that Saudi parents expressed a high level of concern regarding their children’s privacy when using smart device apps. However, they expressed higher concerns about apps’ content than privacy issues such as apps’ requests to access sensitive data. Furthermore, parents’ concerns are not in line with most of the children’s installed apps, which contain apps inappropriate for their age, require parental guidance, and request access to sensitive data such as location. We also discuss several aspects of Saudi parents’ practices and concerns compared to those reported by Western (mainly from the UK) and Chinese parents in previous reports. We found interesting patterns and established new relationships. For example, Saudi and Chinese children have a higher level of autonomy in installing apps on their devices than Western children who mostly request apps installation from their parents. However, there are more Saudi parents who end up uninstalling apps from their children’s devices due to privacy concerns than Western parents. This suggests that parents’ involvement in installing children’s apps is related to a reduced number of uninstallation incidents, which are mostly negatively received by children. Furthermore, Saudi and Western parents show higher levels of privacy concerns than Chinese parents. Finally, we tested 14 privacy practices and concerns against high versus low socioeconomic classes (parents’ education, technical background, and income) to find whether there are significant differences between high and low classes (we denote these differences by “digital divide”). Out of 42 tests (14 properties × 3 classes) we found significant differences between high and low classes in 7 tests only. While this is a positive trend overall, it is important to work on bridging these gaps. The results of this paper provide key findings to identify areas of improvement and recommendations, especially for Saudis, which can be used by parents, developers, researchers, regulators, and policy makers.}

China implemented the first phase of its National Healthy Cities pilot program from 2016-20. Along with related urban health governmental initiatives, the program has helped put health on the agenda of local governments while raising public awareness. Healthy City actions taken at the municipal scale also prepared cities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after intermittent trials spanning the past two decades, the Healthy Cities initiative in China has reached a crucial juncture. It risks becoming inconsequential given its overlap with other health promotion efforts, changing public health priorities in response to the pandemic, and the partial adoption of the Healthy Cities approach advanced by the World Health Organization (WHO). We recommend aligning the Healthy Cities initiative in China with strategic national and global level agendas such as Healthy China 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing an integrative governance framework to facilitate a coherent intersectoral program to systemically improve population health. Achieving this alignment will require leveraging the full spectrum of best practices in Healthy Cities actions and expanding assessment efforts.

This combination, referred to as city DNA, influences how each city will evolve from both an urbanistic and technological point of view. The ability for a city to adopt technology depends on the initial state or Net Present Potential of the city based on its DNA. To explain the Net Present Potential, the concept of the “initial value problem,” also called a Cauchy problem as borrowed from physics, is applied to the evolution of technologies for the purpose of developing benchmarks to understand how each city will evolve over time. In this regard, each city must fully understand and leverage its unique resources and characteristics to develop the appropriate strategies and solutions, from Leapfrog to Acceleration, for how technology will enable the city to achieve an optimal state. For nature, the optimal state is homeostasis, or balance, for humankind it is actualization or well-being and for technology it is efficiency or optimization. Convergence theory is introduced to underline the process of how cities are transforming as a human-biological-technological amalgamation and that this is occurring at different rates and different qualities of cities around the world. The ultimate convergence is the fusion of human and machine intelligence to establish a higher collective intelligence that self-operates the sustainable smart city.}

Among them, the importance index of passing flow is calculated by the PageRank algorithm. According to these characteristics, metro stations are classified by k-means clustering algorithm after dimensionality reduction. The case study is conducted through nearly five million records from 278 stations in Beijing. From the classification results, stations are divided into six categories. Qualitative and quantitative regulations are proposed to reduce the risk of high ridership stations and improve the operation efficiency for few ridership stations.}

The significance of automation and energy optimization is prominent in providing secure and reliable control over in-home applications. Security is one of the drawbacks in smart home scenarios where the connected network of applications and sustainable energy sources are exposed to risk. This article introduces the seamless security apprises method (SSAM) to monitor the connected network's administered security measure. The proposed method monitors the lifetime of the administered security measures by verifying its exploitation and vulnerable levels in a periodic manner. In this verification process, the distributed security is classified for different operating and communicating states of the connected applications. For this state-based analysis, Q-learning is adapted to identify and update the state and its associated security measure. It reduces the early termination of the security measure due to identity thefts and provides continuous support for the operating applications. Therefore, sustainable energy resources are efficiently exploited without facing convergence in application functions. The cyber security features of the connected network are exploited in administering the security from a centralized platform. The proposed method's performance is verified using the verification time, security level, energy efficiency, and security loss.}

abstract = {This work describes the implementation of a cost-effective assistive mobile application aiming to improve the quality of life of visually impaired people. Taking into account the architectural adaptations being done in many cities around the world, such as tactile sidewalks, the mobile application provides support to guide the visually impaired through outdoor/indoor spaces making use of various navigation technologies. The actual development of the application presented herein has been done taking into account that the safety of the end user will very much depend on the robustness, accuracy and timeliness of the information to be provided. Furthermore, we have based our development on open source code: a must for applications to be adapted to the cultural and social characteristics of urban areas across the world.}

abstract = {The growing calls for connectivity, capability, and agility as determinants of sustainability in the built environment entail a growing need to improve the smart infrastructure particularly in terms of the electrical grid and communication-enabled solutions. Innovation through design is making the electricity industry experiences the same sort of rapid development as the information and communication technology industry has undergone during the past 30 years. Today, electrical utilities have the opportunity of seizing the potential of advanced communication, computing, and control technologies where smart technologies are the existing hub of innovation. To realize this fact, it is essential to integrate smartness and intelligence at all levels of the built environment infrastructure. This chapter explains how utilities and consumers are enabled to pool power from multiple plants and distributed sources to achieve high flexibility and scale by taking advantage of the smart grid capabilities. By integrating energy efficiency, distributed energy generation technologies, and demand flexibility into buildings, the state of the art in grid-interactive efficient buildings can be advanced. Such integration is feasible with the deployment of smart electrical load management strategies supported by sensor and actuator wireless networks that offer potential on the path toward Tactile Internet, Internet of Energy, smart urban mobility, net-zero energy buildings, and ultimately long-term sustainability and health.}

abstract = {Smart devices are commonly used these days, especially in smart cities, resulting in massive social media engagement and heavy workload generation. Statistics show that over 4.41 billion people will subscribe to social media by 2025, which covers the majority of the world’s population. Its versatility and enriched features allow users to upload and download large data (e.g, High Definition (HD)) videos and HD live streaming). This heavy workload overburdens the mainstream network and social media cloud, increasing the delay and costs for instant communications. To cope with the aforementioned challenges, this paper aims to minimize the social big data effects on the mainstream network and the social media cloud servers. In connection with these objectives, a survey result shows that 75% of social connections originate from the local region, and their data has no need for instant migration to the remote cloud servers. We extended the Edge/Fog computing concept to create Regional Computing (RC) for Social Media Platforms (SMP). These servers are created at the regional level. Initially, the data is stored and processed at regional computing servers and later on, in off-peak hours, migrated to the cloud servers. The initial result shows that the regional computing servers filter the content regionally and minimize the burden on the mainstream network. It also reduces the cloud server’s workload, resulting in minimal delays and costs.}

abstract = {Urban heat island and global warming increase the urban ambient temperature. Increased temperatures have a tremendous effect on the energy demand for cooling, with a great impact on peak and total electricity demand. Renewable technologies in the urban environment have been widely regarded as an increasingly important solution to deal with the climate change challenges and energy security. Significant effort is performed in the integration of photovoltaic panels (PV) and micro turbines in the urban context showing a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions. At the same time attention is drawn to an often-overlooked aspect regarding renewable energy technologies, in that despite having low operating costs their overall benefits are often not well understood and consequently are often evaluated as being less profitable than fossil fuel alternatives, even though they are future proof about energy cost. The aim of the present paper is to describe the role of renewable energy technologies and zero carbon technologies in covering the future increased energy demand for cooling. The integration of photovoltaics in the urban environment through PV facades, pavements, and shading devices are discussed. The role of Information and Computer Technology and smart grids in the efficient management of renewables in urban scale is discussed. The role of smart metering, users ‘integration and demand response capabilities for future zero energy urban neighborhoods is revealed.}
