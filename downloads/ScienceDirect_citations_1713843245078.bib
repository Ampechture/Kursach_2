abstract = {Smart cities and healthcare services have been gaining much attention in recent years, as the benefits offered by this field of research are significant and improve quality of life. Systems can proactively detect health problems by monitoring a person’s vital signs and make automated decisions to prevent these problems from worsening. With this in mind, we highlight two essential requirements that smart city architectures should consider to achieve elevated quality of experience in the healthcare domain. The first is to process high-priority vital signs with short response times, so people with comorbidities can have health problems identified as soon as possible. The second is to employ scalability techniques to deal with high usage peaks resulting from people concentrating in specific city neighborhoods. This paper contributes to this field of research by proposing SmartVSO - a computational model of a hierarchic, scalable, tree-based, fog-cloud architecture that executes healthcare services with reduced response time for urgent vital signs. Fog computing is employed to reduce response times, and cloud computing is used to provide virtually infinite computing resources. Serverless computing is the main technology we consider for deploying and running healthcare services because this allows authorized companies to implement their own services in a distributed and pluggable approach, without recompiling the proposed modules and reducing scalability concerns for engineers. An experiment with 80,000 vital signs indicates that our solution processes 60% of the very critical ones in no more than 5.3 s, while an architecture without fog computing and without prioritization takes up to 231 min (around 3 h and 51 min) to process 60% of very critical vital signs.}

abstract = {Controlled environment farming has become an attractive solution to increase the food production with limited use of resources. LED lights are often used in this type of farming to increase plant yield. LED lights are dc load, whereas the grid provides ac power. This necessitates the use of power factor correction (PFC) converter as an interface between the grid and the lights. This paper proposes an innovative control method for the boost PFC converter, where an advanced phase-locked loop scheme is developed that can eliminate measurement dc offset and provide harmonic robust estimation of the grid voltage fundamental component. The applied nonlinear control uses the existing two-loop control architecture. Based on a baseline PI controller, a nonlinear function is added to make the controller react faster when it is far from the reference and vice-versa. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method under various challenging test scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, the proposed technique achieved 42%∼65% reduction in total harmonic distortion depending on the test cases, which makes the technique a suitable candidate for improving the operational efficiency and, consequently, the running cost of a smart farming lighting system on an industrial scale. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the conventional counterpart.}

The aim of this paper is to showcase the work of the TRACKPLAST research project, first conceived in 2017 and submitted as a funding application in 2018, resulting in the development of the TRACKPLAST smart bottle and its successful tracking during its land journey, which to our knowledge constitutes the first non-GPS attempt to track plastic waste, identify its inland sources and follow its routes before it enters the sea. Waste tracking is made possible through the development of an open source LoRa-based wireless sensor network, enhanced with gateways and complemented by a cloud platform for the geolocation and visualization of bottle positions and routes. The project’s LoRa IoT sensor and antenna are seamlessly embedded in the specially designed TRACKPLAST bottle, which being identical and almost as light as the actual waste, can replicate close-to-true movement patterns when disposed in the environment. The pilot implementation of the proposed technology took place in the Greek island of Syros, where sixty-nine smart bottles were disposed freely in the environment between April 4 and May 5, 2022. The TRACKPLAST cloud platform was able to locate, track and visualize on a map, the signals of the smart bottles throughout their entire battery lifecycle and until June 24, 2022, when the last device stopped emitting its signal. The proposed solution aspires to contribute to the alleviation of marine plastic pollution, through the collection, processing and visualization of plastic waste movement data, which if treated properly can support decisions for improving the responsiveness and efficiency of waste management systems.}

abstract = {A comparative analysis is presented of a smart window with grating filter and a conventional smart window fully covered with switchable layer using the same chromogenic material in its colored and bleached states. The filter, formed by two thin-film gratings with alternating transmissive and chromogenic strips, has an angular-selective transmission of direct sunlight. Both gratings are sloped on the window plane at an angle to the horizontal, calculated taking into account the window azimuth to adapt to the solar trajectory relative to this window. The previously obtained calculation methods are modified and expanded, on the basis of which the temporal characteristics of light and solar transmittance, as well as direct and diffuse illuminance and irradiance indoors, of windows with two different southeast azimuths for June 15, September and December are calculated. The results show two main advantages of a grating smart window over a conventional one. Firstly, in active (colored) mode, due to angular selectivity of transmission it has self-adjusting light and solar transmittance throughout the day and year without using the daylight shading/redirecting devices, and in the bleached state, it has a higher transmittance. Secondly, by adjusting the transmission of direct sunlight, the filter transmits more than twice as much diffuse light in both colored and bleached states, thereby increasing indoor comfort in any season.}

This article highlights the critical importance that higher education plays in achieving national development goals through an analysis of the policies, incentives and strategies supporting Mauritius’ ambition to be a respected and sustainable education hub. The three higher education strategies Mauritius uses include the recruitment of international higher education providers primarily from Europe, India and the UK as well as international students from around the world; the Smart City initiative which focuses on the creation of new cities where higher education is core to its purpose and function, and the establishment of bilateral academic partnership/network with other countries. Analysis of national data from 2011 to 2019 showed that these strategies have significantly contributed to increased access to higher education for both domestic and international students, a diversified program and provider offer based on three branch campuses, over 35 different international education providers, and a four-fold increase in international students enrollment. The article, using an analytical framework for education hubs assesses Mauritius’ current position as a student hub. Finally, the opportunities and challenges facing Mauritius as a student-oriented education hub are discussed. International higher education researchers, policy makers, and experts will benefit from the lessons learned from Mauritius’ development as an education hub and how it supports the transition of Mauritius from a society and economy based on natural resources to one which prioritizes education, service, knowledge and human development.}

abstract = {In this paper, I present B-DRIVE—a blockchain-based distributed IoT (Internet of Things) network for smart urban transportation. The network is designed to connect a large fleet of IoT devices, installed on various vehicles and roadside infrastructures, to distributed data storage centers, called as Full-Nodes, to log and disseminate sensor generated data. It connects devices from around the city to multiple Full-Nodes to log timestamped data into the blockchain. These sensors vary from GPS (Global Positioning System), air quality meter, gyrometer to speed cameras in order to facilitate efficient urban mobility. The three identified hardware layers that comprise the network are the IoT layer, Storage layer, and User layer. They consist of Moving/Static-Nodes, Full-Nodes, and Smart devices, respectively. The Moving/Static-Nodes are primarily made up of moving vehicles and road-side infrastructures, respectively, thus acting as various data sources. Whereas, Full-Nodes and Smart devices are institutions and mobile phones, acting as data handler/disseminator and navigator/data visualizer, respectively. The data, or data blocks, received by Full-Nodes get appended into Full and Running-Blockchain, meant for specific purposes. The network is designed to be free from any block mining activity. It provides open access to anonymous sensor data to end-users, especially scientists, policy-makers and entrepreneurs, to develop innovative urban transportation solutions. It is believed that a system like B-DRIVE, along with existing VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks), is capable of answering some of the current urban transportation issues around traffic congestion, navigation, and vehicle parking. Other applications of blockchain data could vary from user activity mapping to VGI (volunteered geographic information) data quality assessment. Two identified limitations of the presented architecture are the low processing power of current IoT devices and the lack of urban IoT infrastructure.}

In the frame of PV/smart applications, factors such as promotion of building-integrated PV/smart-grid configurations and evaluation of the systems in different countries/markets play a pivotal role. Regarding storage, parameters such as recycling and non-interconnected territories are critical. Moreover, the development of smart grids/smart systems in the building sector is associated with zero-energy buildings, indoor-environment control, polygeneration, policy and so on. From an environmental point of view, the vast majority of the investigations discuss general environmental issues (CO2 emissions; energy savings) and there is a lack of environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies based on multiple life-cycle impact assessment methods and environmental indicators. In light of the issues mentioned above, it can be seen that smart grids/smart systems pose many challenges: residential microgeneration, flexibility and active participation of the users, promotion of renewable energy systems (offshore wind power plants, building-integrated solar systems, etc.), energy transition and so on.}

Teachers’ ability attributions play an important role in students’ educational outcomes. Perceptions of academic abilities, however, are subject to biases. This study aims to examine ethnic biases in homeroom teachers’ ability attributions in Hungarian primary schools.
Design/methodology/approach
Using a unique database combining survey data collected among teachers with administrative data on students’ standardised test scores, the author compares ability attributions towards equally competent minority and majority classmates (Nstudents = 604, Nclasses = 34 in Grade 6; Nstudents = 420, Nclasses = 27 in Grade 8).
Findings
The author finds that Roma students are less likely to be perceived as smart by their homeroom teachers than their non-Roma classmates with similar standardised achievement scores in Grade 6, but not in Grade 8. The ethnic difference in being perceived as smart is substantially reduced after controlling for students’ socioeconomic status and cultural resources. On the other hand, homeroom teachers perceive Roma students to be similarly hardworking and “good students” than equally competent non-Roma students.
Originality/value
This study highlights an important mechanism that can contribute to educational inequalities. The findings suggest that previously found differences between equally competent Roma and non-Roma students’ teacher-given school grades might arise due to biases in ability attributions rather than differences in perceived efforts. It is important to make teachers aware of potential biases in student assessment and evaluation.}

In a traditional distribution system (DS), a consumer call often provides the first information about the fault location. However, the distribution system is gradually becoming more complex due to the addition of composite lines (overhead and underground cable) and various laterals. Further, to increase reliability, a meshed type of distribution system is being designed. The addition of cables at the lateral ends necessitates the use of fault location techniques because they are hidden from consumers' view. An accurate assessment of the fault location is necessary for quick power restoration. However, typical fault location methods applicable in the transmission system have limited performance in the distribution system since the network is often unbalanced and not symmetrical. In addition, with the integration of renewable-based DGs to limit carbon emissions and enhance reliability, the challenge of identifying the faulty section and obtaining the fault location has further increased. On the flip side of technical advancement, loss reduction, asset and demand management, and customer participation are sought through improved system monitoring and the implementation of smart meters and communication systems. With the help of such technological advances, fault location in DS that incorporates renewable energy sources can be improved. This chapter discusses the constraints and future needs of smart meter applications for DS fault localization computation. The benefits of the smart meter data for fault location identification are verified on the IEEE 33 bus distribution system.}

In the first stage, we developed and compared different Deep Learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and CNN-LSTM to predict indoor air temperature in a multi-step time horizon. In the second stage, we implemented a Transfer Learning (TL) process, which aims to improve the prediction performance on a new set of buildings (targets), exploiting the knowledge of related or similar buildings (sources). Different TL strategies and source model identification methods were investigated. The study showed that the CNN-LSTM performed the best among the architectures compared, with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.26 °C for one-hour-ahead (twelve 5-min future steps) predictions. Furthermore, the results showed that freezing the LSTM layer and fine-tuning the other layers of the CNN-LSTM achieved the best performance among four TL strategies, which further improved the performance with respect to a machine learning approach by 10%, and proving the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach. A comparison of three different source model identification methods showed that randomly selecting source models constrained by similar building characteristics can provide good TL performance while retaining simplicity comparing with other quantitative source identification methods.}

However, the development of UV/stress dual-responsive ion-conductive hydrogels with excellent conditioning capabilities for wearable devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we successfully fabricated a gelatin-glycerol-ammonium sulfate (GGS) ionic conductive hydrogel with excellent mechanical properties: high tensile strength of 330 kPa (elongation at break of 225%), high transparency of 90%, good frost resistance (−50 °C), heavy plasticity, and good conductivity. This GGS organic hydrogel has dual responsiveness to UV light and strain. Moreover, the GGS hydrogel has stable electrical signal output in different joint movements, which suggests that it can be used to monitor physiological signals and human movement. Photochromic-GGS hydrogel can achieve reversible color change in response to UV stimulus, and can be used as an outdoor UV intensity indication device. Other than that, the GGS hydrogel also exhibits good re-molding, recyclability, and reusability. Low-cost photochromic-GGS hydrogel's simultaneous stability and environmental friendliness allows GGS hydrogel to be used as a green and sustainable smart material. To the best of our knowledge, these combined features cannot be realized by conventional strategies. Thus, our design strategy for GGS ion-conducting hydrogels promises to be a new generation of "smart" multi-stimuli-responsive hydrogels for visualization of UV-responsive devices, interactive wearables, and visual display devices.}

abstract = {Allocating different capabilities to structural elements simultaneously is still challenging. In this study, a field-applicable multifunctional planar braided composite with the abilities of reinforcing, self-sensing and self-heating was developed for the first time. In this route, three commercial fabrics were used, including cotton, cotton/polyamide, and polyester. The fabrics were first chemically treated and then coated with a carbon nanomaterial-based polymeric conductive paste using screen printing with different concentrations and layers. The samples were then covered and sealed with a thermoplastic polyurethane-based polymer to avoid environmental factors effects. Smart planar composites (SPC) were also used as reinforcement for cementitious specimens. The electrical conductivity and joule heating capability of the samples were also evaluated. The microstructure of the SPCs was investigated using various tests. The mechanical and self-sensing performances of the cementitious composite reinforced with different SPCs were assessed using different load patterns. The results showed a heating rate of 0.44 ˚C/s, a joule heating power of 0.7 W/˚C, and a maximum temperature of 44 ˚C which proved the proper heating capability of the cementitious composites reinforced with SPCs. The great correlation between electrical resistivity changes and strain values indicated the high potential of the composite in strain sensing for different applications. The SPCs also improved the post-crack behaviour of the specimen and its flexural strength and failure strain by approximately 50% and 118%, respectively. The outcomes of this study draw a bright horizon in multifunctional braided composite development with different applications in civil infrastructures, which is a crucial step for intelligent cities' advances.}

A numerical procedure processing the alerts received through the Web-App NOSE, has been developed to produce the proper input to the dispersion module of the SMART meteo-dispersive modelling system. Then, a post-processing numerical code elaborates the simulation output based on a combination of puffs of Lagrangian stochastic particles, released backward in time from the locations and at the time of the citizens’ notifications. This novel approach is presented, it is applied to three real case studies occurred in the area of Siracusa province (Sicily, Italy), then related results are discussed.

As a critical flood control measure, passive urban blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is incapable of effectively utilizing available storage capacity to mitigate peak flows during cloudburst events. At storm peak times, landscape-based BGI may overflow to the drainage system, contributing to downstream flooding risks. To alleviate the effect, this research investigated an adaptive RTC solution that would predischarge the BGI and initiate runoff detention during the most vulnerable period of peak intensity. A case study of a RTC-enhanced landscape detention basin in Tongzhou, Beijing, was conducted using 2D1D modeling. To minimize peak-time overflow under extreme conditions, the studied smart BGI equipped with sensors and electronically movable gates was actuated by both rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms. Modeling results indicate that the proposed predictive solutions reduced catchment peak outflow by 7.6% to 45.1% over the passive system during three historical cloudburst events. This proposal proves that similar RTC applications could be scaled up to additional landscape projects to increase urban sustainability towards climate change and extreme precipitation.}

A smart contract is an executable program that can automatically carry out transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. However, some security issues in smart contracts are difficult to fix, and smart contracts also lack quality assessment standards. Therefore, this study proposes a Multiple-Objective Detection Neural Network (MODNN), a more scalable smart contract vulnerability detection tool. MODNN can validate 12 types of vulnerabilities, including 10 recognized threats, and identify more unknown types without the need for specialist or predefined knowledge through implicit features and Multi-Objective detection (MOD) algorithms. It supports the parallel detection of multiple vulnerabilities and has high scalability, eliminating the need to train separate models for each type of vulnerability and reducing significant time and labor costs. This paper also developed a data processing tool called Smart Contract-Crawler (SCC) to address the lack of smart contract vulnerability datasets. MODNN was evaluated using more than 18,000 smart contracts from Ethereum. Experiments showed that MODNN could achieve an average F1 Score of 94.8%, the current highest compared to several standard machine learning (ML) classification models.}

Infiltrating a lignin-modified wood (LMW) with a solution of methyl acrylate (MA) and rare-earth strontium aluminum oxide (SrAl2O4: Eu2+, Dy3+; SAOED) yielded afterglow and photochromic translucent wood. Preparing photoluminescent transparent wood effectively requires dispersing SAOED phosphor nanoparticles (NPs) in pre-polymerized MA without clumping. CIE (Commission Internationale de ĺEclairage) Lab colorimetric studies indicated that this transparent timber substrate changed color from colorless in daylight to greenish when exposed to ultraviolet rays. Micrographs taken using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) were analyzed to learn more about the morphology of the synthesized SAOED NPs. Different characterization techniques were applied on the photochromic translucent wood samples, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX), hardness properties, wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (WD-XRF), and absorption and emission spectroscopy. Absorption maximum wavelength was detected at 365 nm. Both 436 nm and 517 nm were observed as emission wavelengths in the developed photoluminescence wood. The results displayed that the manufactured transparent wood introduced superior protection from UV radiation and superhydrophobic activity.

The results of this study showed that the key smart port success factors are: (1) accurate and secure delivery of cargo; (2) accurate electronic document transfer; (3) rapid provision of port berths to shorten the turnover time of ships; (4) convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures; (5) transparent information integration on a single platform; and (6) use of big data to arrange container transport. Causal relationships were found among the indicators, including the fact that "convenient and comprehensive logistics and customs procedures" was influenced by “accurate electronic document transfer," "transparent information integration on a single platform," and "use of big data to arrange container transport." The results of this study can help port operators and government agencies identify key success factors for smart ports. This will enable participants in the supply chain to take early measures to respond to the impact of emergencies in the post-pandemic era, thus improving port operations and customer satisfaction.

Specifically, silk yarns are functionalized by customized conductive paints consisted of polyaniline (PANI) and carbon nanotubes (CNT), which selectively etches the interface of yarns without damage of their internal structures. The as-prepared sensing units not only maintain the characters of silk, PANI and CNT, with robust mechanical performances and high conductivity, but also can efficiently monitor a series of critical signals, such as strain, temperature and harmful gas. The sensing units can be sewed into fabric to integrate flexible smart textiles, and the obtained smart textiles preserve the structural integrity and detection capacity under deformations, frictions and water exposure. An integrated textile device is also shown, which consists of display and warning can serve as a health butler, demonstrating the system’s potential within the “internet of things” in various areas, including motion monitoring and smart home.}

abstract = {Heat pumps play an essential role in decarbonizing the building sector, but their electricity consumption can vary significantly across buildings. This variability is closely related to their cycling behavior (i.e., the frequency of on–off transitions), which is also an indicator for improper sizing and non-optimal settings and can affect a heat pump’s lifetime. Up to now it has been unclear which cycling behaviors are typical and atypical for heat pump operation in the field and importantly, there is a lack of methods to identify heat pumps that cycle atypically. Therefore, in this study we develop a method to monitor heat pumps with energy measurements delivered by common smart electricity meters, which also cover heat pumps without network connectivity. We show how smart meter data with 15-minute resolution can be used to extract key indicators about heat pump cycling and outline how atypical behavior can be detected after controlling for outdoor temperature. Our method is robust across different building characteristics and varying times of observation, does not require contextual information, and can be implemented with existing smart meter data, making it suitable for real-world applications. Analyzing 503 heat pumps in Swiss households over a period of 21 months, we further describe behavioral differences with respect to building and heat pump characteristics and study the relationship between heat pumps’ cycling behavior, energy efficiency, and appropriate sizing. Our results show that outliers in cycling behavior are more than twice as common for air-source heat pumps than for ground-source heat pumps.}

Information and communication technologies (ICT) have been proven to be an effective tool in achieving this goal. However, many legacy appliances in commercial and residential buildings are energy-intensive and not connected, making their replacement with new, more efficient models a significant upfront cost. In this paper, a solution is presented that integrates legacy equipment such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and other services into a new internet of things (IoT) platform that can integrate machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify the most effective way of achieving a variety of low-energy goals. Through this platform, features such as flexibility services are enabled, allowing energy cost reduction and other beneficial results. The solution has been tested in real demonstration sites in Ireland, and Greece, considering the specific challenges in each country. The Irish demonstration sites showcased the ability to manage a water heater in a residential building and a CHP unit in a commercial one, resulting in energy consumption reductions of up to 39% and 61%, respectively. In the Greek demonstration sites, the implemented solution in the residential building was able to reduce energy consumption by up to 86% during peak hours, and up to 60% overall, offering a 10% reduction in their monthly bill. In the commercial building the services provided an average of 6.9 kWh (or 4.6%) of energy savings per day leading to a 22% reduction in their monthly electricity bill.}

abstract = {Building energy simulations often rely on abstract assumptions when it comes to natural ventilation, such as ‘windows always open [or closed]’ or ‘windows open when outdoor temperature is below a certain threshold.’ However, simulations based on these assumptions fail to fully exploit the cooling potential of natural ventilation, as its effectiveness can be enhanced or diminished by various factors, including the presence of thermal mass. This issue also extends to smart home controls, where determining the window schedule becomes challenging without information about the building's response to outdoor conditions. To address these issues, this study has developed an analytical model for window operation schedules that leverages the passive cooling from natural ventilation. The analytical model was validated against a Modelica simulation. A case study utilizing the BESTEST model of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140 underwent validation with EnergyPlus simulations, showing strong concordance. The algorithm provides window schedule recommendations adapted to various airflow rates, thermal masses, and climate variations. The case study demonstrated that proper window scheduling could reduce indoor temperature by up to 8 °C under the given simulation settings, thereby improving resilience and indicating potential energy savings. Furthermore, the paper explores the potential opportunities and challenges this approach presents, especially for building simulation and smart home applications.}

We minimize the investment and running costs in the electricity and district heating sectors, considering different levels of connection capacity between the city and the regional energy systems; connection capacities equal to 100%, 75%, 50% and 0% of the maximum city electricity demand. We find that a system design with 50% connection capacity is only 3% more expensive in terms of total costs than a system with 100% connection capacity. However, shifting electricity generation capacity from the regional to the city energy system with 50%, as compared to 100%, connection capacity leads to a higher marginal cost for electricity in the city than in the region. With the highest connection capacities, 75% and 100%, the district heating sector in the city can support wind power integration in the regional energy system by means of power-to-heat operation. Modeling systems with different connection capacities makes our results applicable to other fast-growing cities with potential to increase local electricity production and sector coupling between the electricity, district heating and electrified transport sectors.}

abstract = {Introduction
Approximately 25% of older cancer survivors (i.e., ≥ 65 years, with cancer history) use ≥1 mobility device, surpassing usage by other older adults. Few tools exist for older “survivors” to regain function or follow lifestyle recommendations. Our goal was to explore opportunities to leverage technology-enabled mobility devices, such as the “smart cane,” to support mobility goals in these survivors. The research objective was to assess perceptions related to acceptability, usability and preferences of participants regarding technology-enabled mobility devices in everyday life.
Materials and methods
We used a convergent mixed-methods design, analyzing quantitative data followed by qualitative focus groups. A pre-survey derived from the Senior Technology Acceptance Model assessed the acceptability of technology-enabled devices among participants, who also participated in one of three focus groups delivered via Zoom. The Zoom sessions included facilitated 90-min discussions and video demonstration of the smart cane. Focus group sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim and thematic content analysis was conducted.
Results
We recruited 12 older US survivors. Participants were 58% female, aged 68–86, and 16% non-White. From a pre-survey of participants, 83% said that they liked the idea of technology-enhanced mobility device and 100% said they thought they could be skillful at using a technology-enabled device if training was provided. Though participants were enthusiastic about the smart cane overall and felt the smart cane supported independence for older adults, the themes revealed concerns about safety, accessibility and technology support, as well as the concern for negative impact on self-image due to use of a mobility device. There was a strong preference for working with clinical professionals as the most trusted sources for referrals, if a smart cane was suggested.
Discussion
Older survivors in our sample found the smart cane very acceptable, and supportive of independence for older adults with cancer and other conditions. Participants also provided many insights that revealed additional research needed to support access, safety and usability for older adults, older survivors and caregivers, especially by partnering with clinical professionals.}

abstract = {Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users’ daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.}

There are some smart windows based on widespread technologies and deepen investigated in the scientific literature, such as the electrochromic solution, but there are some others, such as liquid crystal devices, not really investigate, or characterized only by means of simulative analysis, often without calibrated models with experimental data. Thus, the present study aims to investigate, under experimental and numerical point of view, an electric-driven window with liquid crystal technology installed in a full-scale facility located in a Mediterranean climate. A calibrated numerical model is carried out and different windows control logics and future climate projections (to 2050s and 2080s) are analyzed. Among different control logics, the one depending on daylight illuminance level on the work plane shows the best performance, with a total energy saving (lighting and cooling) of -3% with respect a static window in clear state.}

This study conceptualizes and operationalizes smart hospitality and explores the relationships among smartness, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, overall image of a hotel and tourists' behavioral intention to stay in a smart hotel. The proposed model incorporated technology acceptance model (TAM) and image theory. With a sample of 348 respondents in Macau, this study tested the model using partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM), which indicates that the proposed model fits the data. In spite of a high inter-construct correlation, the results showed that smartness does not have a direct effect on behavioral intention. According to mediation analysis, indirect effects made up of significant direct effects and assigned them to TAM, image theory, and a combination of both. This paper contributes to hospitality management theory by providing additional insight into smart hospitality, it demonstrates the applicability of PLS-PM with composite and common factor models in technological change research, and it suggests smartness as a business strategy that can change tourists' choices in practice.}

An Adaptive Deep Neural Network (ADNN) will be developed in this study to secure demand-side management in an IoT-enabled smart grid. The proposed ADNN combines Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA). The SSA is used in the DNN to improve its performance by selecting optimal weighting factors. The proposed methodology will be used to ensure that energy is used efficiently based on its priority level. It will also be used to prevent intrusions into the smart grid. A proposed classifier will classify the intrusion or dishonest entities. To optimize energy utilization and empower security, this proposed multi-agent energy management system (MEMS) and autonomous interface system (AIS) are being developed.

This study investigates the potential role of heat pumps and smart charging of electric vehicles to provide system flexibility in residential neighbourhoods. Photovoltaic self-consumption, district self-sufficiency, annual costs and CO2 emissions have been assessed by simulating the district using the MATLAB toolbox for EnergyPLAN. Furthermore, the impact of the current energy market crisis has been evaluated. Cross-sector integration is crucial to improve system flexibility. Power-to-Heat system has a positive effect on all parameters, however its potential is limited. Power-to-Vehicle strategy is more effective and allows for doubling the community's self-consumption and self-sufficiency. However, the participation of vehicle owners in smart charging schemes is necessary. The combined implementation considerably improves energy, economic and environmental performance and turns out to be much more effective than electric batteries. Finally, the current increase in energy prices also improves the cost-effectiveness of electric batteries and makes the combined implementation of the three systems the best configuration.}

Since IoT devices have limited computing capability, storage, network communication ability, and power supply, they are often vulnerable to cyberattacks when they are deployed in large and complex environments. The digital twin (DT), as a cyber replica of the physical system, is essentially a data-oriented infrastructure that can facilitate the interactions between cyber and physical components, improve the efficiency of IoT systems, and support new services and applications via integrating different IoT systems. In the meantime, DT can be used as a data-oriented architecture to significantly enhance the security of computing and power-constrained IoT devices and improve the security of IoT systems. For example, it can offer predictions to mitigate the potential security impact on the physical subsystems via data analytics based on advanced machine learning (ML) models. In this chapter, we investigate the feasibility of applying DT to secure IoT systems. First, we focus on the study of the layer structure of IoT systems, outline potential threats to IoT systems, and examine the possibility of securing IoT systems using secure DT data services. We create a taxonomy to consider how to apply DT to secure IoT systems from the aspects of DT use, security scope, and security objectives. Furthermore, real threats in IoT systems, such as secure shell protocol (SSH) port brute-force attacks and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, are leveraged in our case studies to demonstrate how DT can protect IoT systems. Finally, we discuss several research directions to secure IoT systems via DT, including DT with self-correction, using a suitable ML model on top of DT, and protecting communications between DT and IoT devices.}

abstract = {Stealthy FDIA (False Data Injection Attack) is a serious cyber threat that can modify state estimation of smart grid through maliciously altering the measurement data, but can’t be detected by traditional bad data detection system in smart grid. There exist two weakpoints for numerous deep neural networks (DNNs) based data-driven schemes against FDIA. First, they mainly focus on detecting the presence of FDIA, but fail to localize the specific bus/nodes affected. Second, their performance is not sufficiently desirable under small attack, i.e., anomalies caused by the attack closely resemble normal data. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an effective locational FDIA detection framework based on data reconstruction, AT-GVAE, which seamlessly integrates the variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial network paradigm. Specifically, our contributions are threefold. First, the proposed AT-GVAE framework is novelly composed of two main modules: the generative VAE_G and discriminative VAE_D that both play dual roles: reconstruct data from jointly learning distributions of data and latent feature space, and meanwhile play Minmax game with adversarial way. Second, multiple-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs) are utilized as the basic structure of the encoder and decoders in both VAEs, to characterize the temporal correlations of measurement data sequence. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism is used to enhance the expressive ability of GRU based VAEs. Then, the anomaly score for each busbar in the smart grid is determined by comparing the residual between the observed measurement and the outputs of VAE_G and VAE_D, enabling the localization of FDIA. Finally, thorough experiments on multiple power systems with series data of total 3456 measurements demonstrate that, in terms of multiple typical metrics, including false alarm rate vs. detection probability, AUC-ROC, and AUC-PR, our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art GRU, VAE and adversarial training based FDIA detection schemes.}

abstract = {The international rollout of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in the residential water supply sector affords tremendous benefits in driving water-use efficiencies, accurate billing and network management (e.g. leak detection). AMI, using ‘smart meters’ fitted at a dwelling level, record water consumption at high temporal resolution. Since water is typically only consumed when householders are present, these data could offer a non-intrusive means of inferring dwelling occupancy patterns. These insights could have a range of benefits dependent upon the spatiotemporal scale and the intended application – our interest is in the potential of these data to identify dwelling type, specifically to identify dwellings that have occupancy patterns associated with tourism, such as second homes or short-term holiday rentals. We focus on these data in a UK context and draw on data rarely available for academic research. Our data relate to a sample of dwellings in Devon and Cornwall, South West England. They capture high-temporal resolution water consumption during Covid-19 ‘lockdown’ and ‘staycation’ periods, providing a unique opportunity to demonstrate that these data can reveal the unusually pronounced property-level occupancy trends evident during this period. We apply Non-Intrusive Occupancy Monitoring (NIOM) to extract dwelling-level occupancy status (occupied/unoccupied) on a day-by-day basis. We group properties according to their occupancy trends, inferring a set of properties that exhibit occupancy characteristics associated with tourism. We demonstrate that these show correspondence with underlying indicators of tourism activity, drawn from AirDNA records of short-term tourist rental properties in this area. Ongoing global rollout of AMI means that these data will be routinely available at the dwelling level and we reflect on the benefits they could provide in generating near real time insights into dwelling occupancy. Drawing on our collaboration with the Office for National Statistics (the UKs national statistical institute) we outline the considerable potential that these data and approaches could offer in the collation of small area housing and tourism statistics.}

abstract = {During the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a central enabler for technological developments and services, such as ambient assisted living and localization services. Billions of smart devices have been sold, with many aged devices still in use today. In several cases, such aged smart devices do not receive security updates after some time of operation, making them a threat to the privacy of end-users. For this reason, it is crucial to understand driving factors for users to keep older devices as well as factors that lead to device switches, which can be considered as a security measure against cyber threats in this context. In this paper, we analyze what factors people associate with replacing older smart devices with newer ones as a way to mitigate the risks linked to aged smart devices. To achieve this, we apply the push-pull-mooring framework to integrate privacy, adoption and switching theories into a unified framework. To empirically validate the framework, we conducted an online survey among N=513 owners of older smart devices (i.e., purchased more than a year ago) from the UK through the Prolific platform. The results of our study show that perceived usefulness of new devices was strongly associated with switching intention. These results offer only limited support for technology adoption theories, as switching intention was not associated with other adoption constructs (pull factors). Privacy concern regarding improper access to personal information collected by an older smart device and switching costs (a push and a mooring factor, respectively) were also associated with switching costs. The results also indicate support for the moderating role of age of smart device, since the latter associations were not significant for smart devices up to three years old. We also provide some practical implications for manufacturers with a green and sustainable future in mind.}

However, research on the short-term effects of air pollutants on OSA severity is limited and inconsistent. We conducted a novel case time series analysis using a nationwide dataset among Huawei smart device users to assess the association between air pollution and OSA severity in a population at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA. Fixed-effects regression models were used to assess the associations between air pollution and the risk of OSA exacerbation, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and oxygen saturation. A total of 51,842 participants who were at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA (mean age [SD]: 45.4 [11.0], 95.5% male) were included, with 6,232,056 person-days of monitoring. The associations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide with OSA severity could occur during the sleep period, and last for 2 days. An increase of 1 interquartile range in the moving average concentrations of air pollution during the sleep period and the 2 previous days was associated with a 1.14%–4.31% increase in the risk of OSA exacerbation, an increase in AHI by 0.05–0.17 events/h, and a decrease in oxygen saturation (%) by 0.003–0.014. The exposure-response curves were almost linear. The associations between air pollutants and OSA were consistently stronger in participants aged 45 years or older. By virtue of the smart device-based technology, this large-scale, nationwide, longitudinal study provides compelling evidence that short-term exposure to air pollution may worsen sleep apnea. Our findings highlight the significance of ongoing efforts to improve air quality in mitigating OSA severity and the relevant disease burden in an aging era.}

However, such two strategies are challenging to be integrated into one window. Herein, a solution for simultaneously regulating the surface tension of the scattering center and the capturing-releasing capacity of pNIPAm for water is implemented, successfully carrying out the enhancement of solar regulation and the reduction of response temperature. The maximum solar shielding and regulation of the modified sandwich structured pNIPAm gel device can reach up to 88.45% and 71.81%, an increase of 52.29% and 73.71% respectively, compared to a pure pNIPAm gel device with the same thickness. Besides, the response temperature is reduced to around 28 ℃, making modified devices have the ability to respond promptly at the comfortable room temperature range boundary (22–28 ℃). Different from flowing, strengthless modified doped microgels, the high-transmittance modified pNIPAm gels maintain the stable patterning performance, and have great potential for further applications. Similar conclusions are obtained using different solvents to reduce the attraction between pNIPAm-water, and the surface tension of water. Therefore, this universal modification framework deserves attention for the future design of energy-saving windows.}

abstract = {Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand–supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is possible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks. The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.}

abstract = {The greenhouse effects of the transportation sector are quite significant as the sector essentially consumes a lot of fossil fuels. To reduce this sector's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, developing smart transportation has emerged as a promising approach. Accordingly, by employing spatial econometric models, we study the impact of smart transportation on CO2 emissions in China. For this purpose, we first assess smart transportation levels in the 30 Chinese provinces for the period 2002–2017. The results indicate that the overall level of smart transportation displays a significant upward trend, and regional heterogeneity exists. Also, a significant spatial spillover effect is found between smart transportation and CO2 emissions in China, implying that a province's carbon mitigation not only depends on the development of its own smart transportation, but also on that of neighboring provinces. Smart transportation can inhibit the CO2 emissions significantly in not only the transportation but also non-transportation sectors. Furthermore, in addition to the direct mitigation effect, smart transportation can also indirectly affect CO2 emissions through transportation scale, structure, and technology effects. The findings of this paper therefore add to the existing literature and provide important policy implications for promoting smart transportation and curbing CO2 emissions in the transportation and other sectors.}

While research on inequalities and injustices in energy transitions is growing, these issues remain less explored in the case of the digitalisation of the energy systems through smart grids and smart homes. This paper aims to synthetise our understandings of inequality, exclusion and vulnerability in energy transitions by systemically analysing different dimensions of marginalisation in the transition to a digitalised electricity infrastructure in Sweden. To synthetise understandings of marginalisation and exclusion, conceptualisations of these processes in different social science approaches to energy studies are reviewed. Moreover, an empirical analysis of interviews with a range of Swedish actors such as energy utilities, social housing developers or pensioner organisations is carried out and enriched by previous research on smart grid users. The empirical analysis demonstrates what specific forms that diverse categories of marginalisation, as already identified generally in different social science approaches to energy studies, may take in smart grids. We argue that marginalisation of household users in smart grids may take place along multiple dimensions, relating to matters of literacy, participation, infrastructure, and the economy. The analysis suggests that bundles of marginalisation aspects concerning household users in sustainable energy transitions should be recognised and addressed simultaneously.}

Windows are important for indoor lighting, cooling, and heating regulation to provide comfortable living for the occupants. However, traditional windows require excessive energy consumption due to uncontrollable light and heat conduction.

The resulting windows show excellent near-infrared (NIR) light modulation and high visible-light transmittance. They display electrochemical performances with long lives of 10,000 cycles, coupled with satisfactory thermal insulation and a wide operating temperature range of −20°C to 40°C. The prepared flexible SWs exhibit robust mechanical properties, suitable for pasting on existing building windows. Energy savings and emission reductions with implementation of the SWs in typical locations under various climate zones in China and around the world are simulated.}

On the other hand, studies showed that the use of smart electrochromic windows by controlling the solar radiation entering the building can affect the energy consumption in buildings. Each smart electrochromic window consists of two basic parts, the electrochromic coating and the control algorithm, which can be modified to improve its energy efficiency. In this study, a hybrid control algorithm is introduced to manage the transparency status of the smart electrochromic window, which uses different algorithms according to the user's presence in the building. When the user is in the building, a just-in-time control algorithm is used, and when the user is not in the building, the value of the decision variable is predicted for future time steps using a deep learning model. Considering the 15-minute time-step, the energy consumption of a building in the mentioned sections was simulated for 6 different climate classes in Iran in 2019. In this study, Fanger’s PMV thermal comfort index was used as the decision variable and the results showed that when this index is in [-0.5,+0.5], the electrochromic window should be transparent. The results showed that the deep learning model must have 5000 nodes and 10 hidden layers to achieve a stable accuracy and the best results were only due to the forecast of the next 15 min. Finally, the results showed that the proposed hybrid control algorithm has been able to increase energy-saving in the mentioned sections of the studied building by at least 26.12% (averagely 31.02%) in all studied climate classes. Also, performing a Pearson Correlation Analysis showed that the hybrid control algorithm was sensitive to the annual indices of maximum temperature, mean temperature, relative humidity, day length, daily sunshine, and global horizontal irradiation. The results showed that the proposed algorithm increased energy efficiency by at least 8.44% compared to its constituent algorithms.}

abstract = {Waste volumes are rising. This is a problem, as they worsen environmental challenges such as climate change. At the same time, however, waste bears valuable resources – yet untapped. The concept of a circular economy bears the potential to unleash these resources. In the short run, only changing the waste sorting behavior of citizens can effectively contribute to circular resource flows, as waste management companies cannot ensure the purity of waste by purely technical means. Aligned with the digital realm, this work focuses on designing a digital artifact that contributes to improved household waste sorting. Using a design science research approach, we develop the artifact's design with input from theory, 23 interviews with potential users and practitioners, and evaluate a prototypical instantiation in a large German city. We contribute to literature and theory by generating design knowledge on information systems for improved biowaste and residual waste sorting by individuals. We derive as key design principles the importance of awareness and transparency, social influence, education and confirmation, and incentives. Our solution embracing those principles enhances the awareness of circular economy processes and the relevance of correct waste sorting. At the same time, our solution is relevant to solving waste management companies' current challenges such as the incineration of valuable biowaste as part of residual waste.}

abstract = {Water is an important resource for life and its existence. Water demand is increasing with increasing economic growth and population, while the water availability is continually depleting making an increasing stress on freshwater resources, necessitating monitoring of water consumption. In addition to controlling the water supply with an efficient water management system, automating the system in terms of both monitoring and operation has received a lot of attention in recent years. Short-term water demand forecast aids in the optimal control of a water supply system and its accurate forecasting helps in reducing operating costs and saving energy. Despite extensive research, the use of demand forecasting for efficient water management has yet to be implemented in India. As a result, the focus of this research is primarily on the model for forecasting short-term water demand using artificial intelligence. A comparative study has been carried out between nine machine learning and deep learning models using the water consumption data over the period from 2020 to 2021 for the city of Hubli in Karnataka. Univariate and multivariate time series forecasting models were considered using the 10-min interval flow meter readings to find the most suitable predictive model. For univariate time series forecasting, only the water consumption was used to predict the water demand, whereas, for the multivariate model, climatic parameters, and calendar inputs (like an hour of the day, holidays, etc.) were considered along with the water consumption data. The results suggest that the deep learning models outperformed the machine learning models, and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model demonstrates the best prediction performance in the two scenarios with a mean absolute error of 0.11 m3/hr for univariate model and 2.96 m3/hr for the multivariate model. The best predictive model can be used to forecast the short-term water demand for any region to ensure sustainable water resource management.}

Ensuring the certification of these restoration processes is vital, as is keeping owners well-informed about the ongoing procedures taking place in their appreciated vehicles. By monitoring and controlling these restoration activities, the management of classic car workshops can effectively optimize their operations, empower owners with pertinent information, and preserve the authentic nature of these vintage automobiles. This study aims to develop a digital twin system for a classic car bodywork restoration shop workshop. The latter integrates multiple sensor technologies, including location tracking, humidity and temperature sensing, accelerometer monitoring, and smart plugs, to facilitate the identification of ongoing activities of classic car bodywork restoration process instances. By leveraging these sensors, the digital twin system may simulate and control workshop operations more effectively. We perform a systematic rapid review of related work and, based on state-of-the-art practices, we identify existing architectures and software applications used for creating digital twin systems. Then, we propose the architecture for our digital twin system, detailing its functionalities. We aim at contributing to advancing digital twin technology in classic car bodywork restoration, enhancing its authenticity, and fostering improved management practices, and overall experience for classic car owners.}

The constructed digital metasurface contains 6 × 6 super unit cells, each of which consists of 4 × 4 active elements with embedded varactor diodes. Together with the DAC and single-chip computer, the speech-recognition module can recognize voice commands and generate corresponding voltage sequences to control the metasurface. In addition, a genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted in the design of the metasurface for efficiently optimizing the phase distributions. To verify the performance of the smart metasurface platform, three typical functions are demonstrated: radar cross-section reduction, vortex beam generation, and beam splitting. The proposed strategy may offer a new avenue for controlling EM waves and establishing a link between EM and acoustic communications.}

This integration enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of electricity demand and supply. However, the increasing reliance on ICT infrastructures has made the SG-CPS more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hence, securing the SG-CPS from these threats is crucial for its reliable operation. In recent literature, machine learning (ML) techniques and, more recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been used by several studies to implement cybersecurity countermeasures against cyberattacks in SG-CPS. Nevertheless, the achieving high performance of these state-of-the-art techniques is constrained by certain challenges, including hyperparameter optimization, feature extraction and selection, lack of models’ transparency, data privacy, and lack of real-time attack data. This paper reviews the advancement in using ML and DL techniques for cybersecurity countermeasures in SG-CPS. It analyzes the constraints that need to be addressed to improve performance and achieve real-time implementation. The various types of cyberattacks, cybersecurity requirements, and security standards and protocols are also discussed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity context in SG-CPS. This paper will serve as a comprehensive guide for new and experienced researchers.}

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how approximately 400 European cities are shaping their governance structures to tackle the complexities of achieving climate neutrality, highlighting the key elements on which cities focus their efforts. This study analyses data collected through the Expression of Interest survey of the European Commission's 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, which contains inputs directly provided by local authorities responsible for implementing climate policies. The results reveal the significant progress cities have made in adapting their governance approaches to effectively address climate challenges through for instance the institutionalisation of climate change, and the introduction of enabling and participative forms of governing with the involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making processes. It also highlights the challenges cities face concerning climate financing and the need to unlock private investments.}

Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes’ measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency. No systematic or generic approach was demonstrated for detecting sensor nodes and sensor node networks failures in large-scale CPS applications. Moreover, further research is required to address the challenges of ensuring the quality of the spatial and temporal contextual attributes of sensor nodes’ observations.}

Consequently, the technologies supporting the driverless functionalities ushered new cybersecurity risks and data privacy breaches.

In the present paper, we considerably extend that investigation by proposing a comprehensive state of the art with farsighted analyses addressing security threats and data privacy concerns from both technical and legal perspectives to thwart potential attacks. Moreover, as existing approaches have not provided yet a clear road map about ACS’s security standards, the present work sheds light on recent and up to date standards and standardisation bodies dealing with cybersecurity and privacy issues in the automated driving ecosystem.

Due to progress in various growing methods of graphene, especially the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method which reduced the cost of its fabrication from ~200 to 2 €/cm2 in the last ten years, graphene became an economically efficient alternative for conductive as well as transparent materials previously being used in technological-based applications. Among them, Indium tin oxide (ITO) has been known as an unrivaled material in the touchscreen manufacturing industry for many years, due to its great properties like high transparency and low electrical resistance. However, the low strain strength of ITO and high price of Indium became its bottleneck for recent progressive electronic-based applications requiring high flexibility (e.g., in wearable smart devices) and low cost. Although graphene has still a long way to go to meet the properties needed to make it suitable for smart touchscreen applications, it has a large potential to be used in such technologies. In this paper, the role of CVD-grown graphene in developing smart touchscreen devices and their world market has been reviewed. In addition, various mechanisms of the present smart touchscreens (including the capacitive, resistive, optical, infrared, and surface acoustic wave mechanisms) have been discussed. Finally, some produced graphene-based flexible smart devices applicable for versatile purposes (from smart panels to biological assays) have been introduced.}

Efficient energy consumption in Smart Cities has a massive impact on the environment. But, computational power is increasing rapidly in the cloud computing environment. Enormous energy consumption (EC) and Service Level Agreement violation (SLAV) becomes a key concern. The Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation approach can significantly reduce EC, SLA violation (SLAV), and increase resource utilization. However, dynamic VM consolidation may produce performance degradation of Physical Machines (PMs) and SLAV. Therefore, it becomes essential to find a trade-off between EC and SLAV. Herein, a novel New Linear Regression(NLR) prediction model, host overload/underload, and VM placement policy have been proposed to reduce EC and SLAV. The NLR model’s primary intention is to take that the model goes through a straight line and a mean point. Future CPU utilization is predicted based on the proposed NLR model. Evaluation of proposed algorithms has been accomplished by extending CloudSim Simulator. The experiment shows that proposed algorithms reduced EC and SLAV in cloud data centers and can be used to construct a smart and sustainable environment for Smart Cities.}

abstract = {Modern smart grids have a complex cyber–physical structure with distributed smart entities and security mechanisms. The application of Internet of things (IoT) technologies can be useful for optimizing the smart grid operation and providing immunity against different cyber-attacks. In this paper, a step-by-step smart modular and scalable design of distribution smart grids is introduced. The proposed plug-and-play procedure enables providing the desired interchangeability for lines/zones inside a distribution network (DN). Thus, keeping DN reconfiguration resilient necessitates the possibility of connecting/disconnecting switches wherever needed inside DN. Therefore, each branch in the DN is equipped by a smart switch that can be remotely controlled via a centralized power IoT platform. The proposed framework, using recent metaheuristic techniques, employs DN reconfiguration for smart grid operation optimization. Most practical issues such as line cost and line parameters are taken into consideration. The framework is examined using the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus systems under various operation scenarios. Besides the base case analysis, both line outage and line input are considered at different positions in the DN. Simulation results reveal the extended smart applicability of the framework, as well as, more efficient functionality over the traditional approaches for improving the smart grid performance via DN reconfiguration considering both soft and hard constraints. The simulation results figure out that the power losses (Ploss) can be minimized by 58.81%, and the minimum voltage magnitude (Vmvm) can be improved by 7.25%, for the 33-bus system. For the 69-bus system, the reduction ratio of Ploss is 64.70%, and Vmvm improvement is 4.48%.}

The optimization analysis considers the impacts of design and operation conditions of commercial buildings including size and orientation of windows as well as the climate characteristics of the buildings. In addition, daylighting benefits are included in the analysis of smart glazing that can transition between clear and dark states as well as intermediate tint levels. The optimization analysis results confirm that smart glazing can provide substantial energy efficiency for office buildings when coupled with daylighting controls especially for cold climates and large windows. However, the analysis indicates that specific set of optical properties for both clear and dark states are required to achieve optimal energy efficiency benefits for smart glazing when applied to office spaces. Indeed, the presented analysis allows the identification of the optimal optical properties for smart glazing depending on several influencing factors including primarily the climate as well as the window size and orientation. Moreover, the magnitude of the annual energy savings achieved by the smart glazing depends largely on the optical properties of the static glazing type used as a reference. Using code-compliant static glazing as a reference, the energy savings incurred by smart glazing range from 1.2% to 13.3% depending on daylighting controls and climatic conditions.}

abstract = {In urban areas, public transport can improve sustainable transport by reducing vehicles and congestion, and improving accessibility. Mass rapid transit (MRT) is especially important for large cities, such as Taipei City, Taiwan. In particular, MRT aims to improve mobility and reliability, but has limitations in providing first and last mile accessibility to final destinations or origins. Taipei City, Taiwan has introduced a public bike sharing scheme to service this gap. However, few studies have addressed how a public bike sharing scheme assists first and last mile accessibility. This study uses Taipei City as a case study to investigate this issue by comparing the demand and supply of the public bike sharing scheme, YouBike, at a detailed spatial scale. The supply of YouBike is represented by the time saving compared to walking for each identified origin and destination pair in the study area (i.e., Point of Interests (POIs) and MRT stations). The demand for YouBike is total trips from each YouBike station to a MRT station using public transport smart card data. By comparing the demand and supply for over 400 zones or villages, service gaps and areas of unbalanced service can be identified. The results show that YouBike does provide first and last mile service for the MRT network with some evidence of service mismatch in the study area, i.e., high service for low demand and vice versa. The conclusions of the paper can help cities wanting to introduce a bike sharing schemes to improve first and last mile transport.}

Social media has revolutionized our societies. It has made fundamental impact on the way we work and live. More importantly, social media is gradually becoming a key pulse of smart societies by sensing the information about the people and their spatio-temporal experiences around the living spaces. Big data and computational intelligence technologies are helping us to manage and analyze large amounts of data generated by the social media, such as twitter, and make informed decisions about us and the living spaces. This paper reports our preliminary work on the use of social media for the detection of spatio-temporal events related to logistics and planning. Specifically, we use big data and AI platforms including Hadoop, Spark, and Tableau, to study twitter data about London. Moreover, we use the Google Maps Geocoding API to locate the tweeters and make additional analysis. We find and locate congestion around the London city. We also discover that, during a certain period, top third tweeted words were about job and hiring, leading us to locate the source of the tweets which happened to be originating from around the Canary Wharf area, UK's major financial center. The results presented in the paper have been obtained using 500,000 tweets.}

Aging infrastructure coupled with rising demand for electricity and environmental concern regarding the industry’s carbon footprint has made it crucially important for the electricity industry to transform its existing, outdated power grid into the next generation smart grid. Smart grids will provide utilities with new capabilities, such as load-side management, peak shaving, power conservation, and integration of renewable sources of energy into the energy portfolio. Smart grids enable utilities to better manage the industry’s carbon footprint while deferring major capital expenditure through energy conservation, increased operational efficiencies, and a richer portfolio of renewable sources of energy. This section will provide an overview of smart grid technologies, its constituent components, and the primary drivers for its development. Moreover, we will discuss the evolutionary path that utilities are likely to take to help their legacy grid transition to the next generation smart grid.}

Therefore, how to establish the evaluation indicator system of smart grid is of great significance to the construction and operation of smart grid. This paper proposes an indicator-based smart grid service evaluation system from four aspects of safety, serviceability, sustainability and intelligence. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation model is established by using analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy evaluation method.

An active challenge of SMS is to satisfy the ever-changing conditions of industries, supply networks, and customer needs. To operate effectively, SMS should be flexible enough to perform automatic or semi-automatic adjustments to manufacturing processes in response to unexpected changes, a feature called context awareness. Recent advances in interpreting context data in the semantic web have permitted SMS to understand the active situation of manufacturing processes. This paper presents a literature analysis of context-aware workflow management approaches in the smart manufacturing domain, with a particular focus on semantic web-based approaches published from 2015 to 2022. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology was applied to analyze the state-of-the-art via the PICOC method. The contributions of this work are (1) an SLR about context-aware workflow management for smart manufacturing systems focusing on semantic web-based approaches, (2) a systematic taxonomy to break down the approaches in conformity based on content and main workflow management function area, and (3) identification of opportunities for improvement in technical features such as context awareness, use case implementation, tools employed, licensing, security, and scalability. A novel architecture and components are also proposed to address the identified active challenges.}

First, the paper analyzes the current state of carbon trading in China's power sector and identifies the future development trend and barriers to carbon trading in China. Second, a framework for a smart carbon trading system based on the structure and traits of blockchain technology is created to optimize the carbon trading process. Third, the smart contract for the smart carbon trading system is built (including execution logic, transaction matching, contract fulfillment, and other elements). This mechanism measures the reputation of trading users. Finally, policy suggestions are provided to solve the current issues and challenges.

Recently, the trio of COVID-19, digitalization, and decarbonization (CDD) has emerged as core challenges whilst providing numerous opportunities for building adaption and resilience for the port industry. In light of this, the sixth generation ports (6GP) model has emerged. This paper addresses crucial research gaps by empirically testing the 6GP model, emphasizing the impact of emerging factors of the CDD, including 1) the lack of empirical testing for the 6GP model and the emphasis on the CDD; 2) the exploration of factors contributing to the significant development of Chinese container ports; 3) the investigation into how the CDD lead to the reversal of the port devolution continuum path. In doing so, an empirical study has been conducted, focusing on six major container ports in mainland China, all of which are among the world’s top 10 container ports in terms of container throughput. It evaluates the importance of the criteria of the 6GP model with the performance of the six ports. The findings of this research are discussed for managerial and policy implications, enriching the existing literature on port devolution, and providing the port industry with a holistic view of port development and strategy in the post-pandemic period.}

However, buildings also account for nearly 40% of energy and 74% of electricity use in the United States and thus largely influence the load shapes on the electric grid. Buildings also are responsible for approximately 36% of CO2 emissions. The performance of these buildings is strongly influenced by the occupants that use them and their energy-consuming behaviors. Most buildings, however, are not designed or operated to intelligently monitor their systems’ performance and occupants’ usage. With the emergence of the concept of smart cities and smart buildings, and the growth in available sensors and sensor systems, the ubiquitous availability of internet connectivity, data storage, communication networks, and protocols, there is an increasing opportunity to actively monitor and collect building systems data. This includes occupancy-related data using occupancy sensor systems. This data can be used to inform building controls to target energy use reductions and efficiency improvements while maintaining occupant comfort. Occupancy recognition technologies have been developed to collect occupancy information, including both single sensor systems and sensor fusion technologies. These technologies and systems include a broad range of sensor types and modalities. Such systems should be able to reliably detect occupants, should be easy to commission, and should, through connection with and control of the HVAC, lighting, and/or other building systems, help to reduce energy consumption and/or demand of a building. There are a variety of factors that influence the ability of a sensor system to detect occupants, such as interior building layout and geometry, lighting levels, and occupant characteristics, among others. This impact varies depending on the sensor system used and its corresponding algorithms. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the types of occupancy sensors systems for buildings, sensing modalities, and corresponding variables found to impact sensor performance in terms of reliability and ease of commissioning. It also discusses various methods and metrics used to evaluate sensor system performance. This helps to provide guidance for various stakeholders interested in smart buildings and building systems, particularly for occupied buildings.}

Practical examples in these sense can be found in pollution monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, or smart city government. Since such sensor networks may gather and collect sensitive data on citizens’ habits or used by a malicious adversary to conduct attacks, security is a key concern for such networks, and access control represents a demanding feature in order to provide it. While the current literature is rich with several kinds of models to control access in sensor networks and a novel one is not needed, it is necessary to theorize a means to let different models coexist within a given network. In this paper, we presents such a problem and deal with it by means of a semantic approach focused on ontologies, and how matching different ontological descriptions of access control models so as to make them interoperable.}

Thus, the design of an efficient data dissemination strategy is of paramount importance. The thriving challenge would be to inform interested devices about an event and to avoid as far as possible the network collision problem. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new generic and adaptive data Dissemination Strategy in Connected Environments (DSCE). Our strategy’s main thrust is reaching a high delivery ratio as well as a low network overhead by sending messages only to the interested devices. To do so, we rely on a semantic-based approach to define device interests and to identify salient messages. Moreover, to cope with the broadcast storm problem and to organize the scheduling of data dissemination, we provide a new waiting time measure for each device before rebroadcasting any received message. The performed experiments show that our strategy outperforms its competitors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.}

abstract = {To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.}

abstract = {Many of the Industry 4.0 approaches are of a technical nature, and by developing new intelligent technologies and adapting and transferring existing techniques, they will help increase productivity in industry. However, human resources will play a central role also in future factories, thus they are a key factor for implementing Industry 4.0. The role and job profile of employees in the smart factories will change in the future and it will be increasingly challenging for SMEs to compete with large corporations in the fight for skilled workers. In the smart city of tomorrow, production sites will be integrated in the sense of an ‘urban production’ in a city-friendly way becoming more interesting for talents and qualified work force. Thus, this paper discusses the imminent shortage of skilled workers with a focus on SMEs. The proposed concept of urban production gives an overview of measures to overcome the shortage of qualified workers. The paper aims to show that urban production is a concept to achieve a socially sustainable symbiosis between companies and the city of the future.}
