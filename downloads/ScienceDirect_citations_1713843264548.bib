abstract = {Building Information Models (BIMs) and City Information Models (CIMs) have flourished in building and urban studies independently over the past decade. Semantic enrichment is an indispensable process that adds new semantics such as geometric, non-geometric, and topological information into existing BIMs or CIMs to enable multidisciplinary applications in fields such as construction management, geoinformatics, and urban planning. These two paths are now coming to a juncture for integration and juxtaposition. However, a critical review of the semantic enrichment of BIM and CIM is missing in the literature. This research aims to probe into semantic enrichment by comparing its similarities and differences between BIM and CIM over a ten-year time span. The research methods include establishing a uniform conceptual model, and sourcing and analyzing 44 pertinent cases in the literature. The findings plot the terminologies, methods, scopes, and trends for the semantic enrichment approaches in the two domains. With the increasing availability of data sources, algorithms, and computing power, they cross the border to enter each other’s domain. Future research will likely gain new momentums from the demands of value-added applications, development of remote sensing devices, intelligent data processing algorithms, interoperability between BIM and CIM software platforms, and emerging technologies such as big data analytics.}

In Saudi Arabia, significant amounts of energy are lost through external envelope façades due to the integration of conventional glazing systems. Thus, in this work, experimental characterisation and numerical analysis were carried out on a scale model integrated with a Polymer-Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) smart window in a hot desert climate. In the first part of this paper, an outdoor scale model was used to evaluate the thermos-optical properties of a PDLC smart window. The experiments were conducted in the spring season in actual conditions, while the state of the window (transparent and opaque) was adjusted. The data were validated and employed to develop a numerical model for energy consumption and visual comfort analysis. A comprehensive parametric analysis of the window-to-wall ratio (WWR) in cardinal orientation was carried out using the EnergyPlus9.4 and Climate Studio packages. The results indicated that the PDLC glazing in the system was able to achieve the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) LEED4.1 standard partially due to the increased Annual Sunlight Exposure ASE>1000lx 250h, even with low transmittance and WWR in both states. The binary behaviour of the PDLC glazing was able to reduce the emission of CO2 from 32.5–89 kg CO2/m2 using the WWR fully for the transparent and opaque states, respectively. Overall, this study contributed to the knowledge on the integration of smart glazing in buildings with low energy consumption and indoor daylighting in a hot desert climate.}

Despite the strong evidence pointing to the expected benefits of using high-frequency pressure and acoustic sensors to optimise urban water supply, there is limited evidence of their derived applications in real, large-scale smart water networks (SWNs). Through a systematic literature review of case studies in real, operational SWNs equipped with high-frequency pressure and/or acoustic sensors, this study identified best practices, drivers, enablers, and challenges of implementing SWNs, while providing targeted directions for future research. Key applications derived from sensors data included online hydraulic modelling, leak detection and localisation, and proactive asset management, using either, or a combination of, process-based and data-driven models. Reported applications were site-specific and most of them were limited to urban locations in developed countries. Most reported applications used pressure sensors data while applications using acoustic sensors data were limited. Applications based on pressure data included online water demand prediction, water quality control, leak detection, and risk-based asset replacement, while acoustic data were used for precise leak detection and localisation, and early detection of pipeline cracks. Applications were able to support urban water management under field conditions but often had limited applicability (e.g., single leak detection, assumption of uniform pipeline material). A lack of standardisation in case studies regarding the characterisation of the physical infrastructure of the SWN (e.g., number of sensors per pipeline length; water and economic savings) was observed. It is suggested that water managers and researchers should focus on reporting benefits and challenges of developing and implementing high frequency sensors applications in standardized and transferrable ways to enable benchmarking.}

To address these gaps, our study presents data from semi-structured expert interviews and a review of the recent literature. Although we draw from empirical data collected in the United Kingdom, we place our findings in the context of Europe because the UK has access to European markets for smart home technologies and platforms. Our sampling strategy included experts from Amazon, Microsoft, the International Energy Agency, government, academic, and civil society stakeholders. We identify a diversity of definitions associated with smart home technologies and draw from our data to discuss applications centred on digital connections, enhanced control, automation, and learning. We analyse fifteen distinct business models for smart home technologies, ranging from energy services and household data monitoring to assisted living, security and safety, and new advertising channels (among others). Our assessment ought to guide future innovation patterns, technology deployment, and policy activity relating to smart homes, especially insofar as they can deliver energy services more affordably or help meeting carbon mitigation priorities.}

This method has proved, through simulations, that the self consumption could be increased, but the benefit of the approach has not been tested on a low voltage distribution system. To increase the quality of grid impact analyses of the smart charging scheme, probabilistic methods that include input and spatial allocation uncertainties are more appropriate. In this study, a probabilistic load flow analysis is performed by modelling the variability of electric vehicle mobility, household load, photovoltaic system generation, and the adoption of photovoltaic system and electric vehicle in society. The results show that the smart charging scheme improves the low voltage distribution system performance and increases the correlations between network nodes. It is also shown that concentrated allocation has more severe impacts, in particular at lower penetration levels. This paper can form the basis for the development of probabilistic impact analysis of smart charging to allow society to integrate more electric vehicles and photovoltaic systems for a more sustainable future.}

Shenzhen, China, was used as a case study. The results showed that with EVs batteries providing storage service to PV, PV self-consumption can be significantly improved from 78% in the PV only system to 95% in the PV + EV system by 2030. The system can supply 37% of the total power demand in Shenzhen, which is double the current electricity generation capacity. With reduced grid power consumption and oil combustion in vehicles, citywide CO2 emissions can be reduced by 42%. Avoided expenditures on fuel and electricity outweigh the additional capital investment of PV and EVs, leading to a total net cost savings of 21%. Compared to the PV system alone, the PV + EV system could provide more comprehensive benefits for Shenzhen. The analytical framework is generalizable to most cities in China and abroad that have yet to experience an increase in EV uptake.}

It looks at the phenomenon of so-called courtship in the early formation of collaboration for business model innovation; wherein organizations contest justifications for smart home business partnerships based on orders of worth, including that of sustainability as a ‘green’ order of worth. It considers the case of the VELUX Group with the release of their smart home device VELUX Active and the development of business ecosystems from the remote-control wireless devices of 2005 to the smart home groupings of 2020 to better understand why there is not more widespread implementation of business models designed for sustainability. The research finds that although a green order of worth, representing sustainability value, may be frequently argued, that market and industrial orders of worth have demonstrated greater maturity in arguments and value reframing that determine the basis of smart home collaborations. Further, it supports a growing body of research suggesting that business model innovation processes are experimental and gradual, and that iterative structural prototypes and piloting of sustainability activities can potentially bridge the design-implementation gap.}

However, large-scale integration of PV generation and EV charging loads poses technical challenges for the distribution grid. Each grid has a specific hosting capacity limiting the allowable PV and EV share. This paper presents a combined PV–EV grid integration and hosting capacity assessment for a residential LV distribution grid with four different energy management system (EMS) scenarios: (1) without EMS, (2) with EV smart charging only, (3) with PV curtailment only, and (4) with both EV smart charging and PV curtailment. The combined PV–EV hosting capacity is presented using a novel graphical approach so that both PV and EV hosting capacity can be analyzed within the same framework. Results show that the EV smart charging can improve the hosting capacity for EVs significantly and for PV slightly. While the PV curtailment can improve the hosting capacity for PV significantly, it cannot improve the hosting capacity for EVs at all. From the graphical analysis, it can be concluded that there is a slight positive correlation between PV and EV hosting capacity in the case of residential areas.}

The data and process requirements for service integration facility is derived from various smart healthcare services.
Results
The proposed model is evaluated using two-step ontological modeling testing method, applied at the ontological framework of integrated smart health services. First evaluation step has targeted the model consistency validation using reasoning tool while querying tools are used to validate the retrieved data entities and relations among them for predefined use-cases.
Conclusions

In order to provide access to larger bandwidths and higher frequencies, the 5G network increases the complexity of the RF front-end components. Designers have to satisfy tighter specifications for realizing components such as filters, antennas, phase shifters, power amplifiers and switches. In order to optimize the energy consumption in the RF front-end module, nonvolatile components could be used as memristors. Memristors are potential candidates to enable reconfigurability and tunability of RF and microwave components. In this chapter, we present possible memristor applications in the design of RF/microwave components such as reconfigurable multi-band filters and digital phase shifters. The main idea is to replace traditional RF/microwave switches with memristors in order to reduce power consumption. For microwave filter design, memristors could be used to realize reconfigurability of the multi-band bandpass planar filters.}

abstract = {Objectives
The increasing trend of β-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide problem. This study investigated isolates of the tribe Proteeae (Proteus, Providencia and Morganella) causing intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections from the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected from 2008–2011.
Methods
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on isolates with an ertapenem minimum inhibitory concentration >0.5mg/L or those phenotypically producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs, AmpC β-lactamases and carbapenemases were detected by multiplex PCR.
Results
A total of 142 isolates, including Proteus mirabilis (n=121), Proteus vulgaris (n=3), Providencia stuartii (n=5), Providencia rettgeri (n=6) and Morganella morganii (n=7), were analysed. Proteus mirabilis was generally susceptible to ertapenem (∼90%) compared with imipenem (≤25%). The most common ESBLs were CTX-M types (n=64), followed by TEM (n=27) and SHV (n=7). CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-15 were the dominant CTX-M-type ESBLs in P. mirabilis isolates. CMY (n=14), which included CMY-2 (n=6), was the most common AmpC β-lactamase, followed by DHA (n=6) and FOX (n=4). NDM (n=7), which included NDM-1 (n=4), was the most common carbapenemase, followed by KPC (n=2). Isolates from hospital-associated infections had more complicated β-lactamase combinations than isolates from community-acquired infections.
Conclusion
The global emergence and spread of β-lactamase-producing Proteeae isolates are major issues in tackling antimicrobial resistance. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance trends and developing further resistance surveillance are necessary.}

Specifically, finding an appropriate parking spot is challenging for vehicle users while moving. Renting private parking spots is worthwhile using information and communications technology to solve parking challenges and offers mutual benefits to vehicle users and parking spot owners. However, security and privacy are prime concerns, as unknown vehicle users use private parking spots. The existing parking schemes are vulnerable to important security and privacy attributes and also inefficient due to high computational costs. We propose secure and lightweight communication protocols for smart parking management (named as SAMPARK) using lightweight cryptographic primitives, (i) to send available parking information and (ii) to reserve a parking spot ahead of time. Security proofs are discussed based on the random oracle model to confirm the security robustness of SAMPARK, considering vital vehicular communication attacks for security analysis. The test-bed results (on Raspberry Pi 3B+) show that the SAMPARK is relatively efficient in computation time, storage cost, and communication overhead.}

abstract = {Recent advancement of remote sensing technologies has brought in accurate, dense, and inexpensive city-scale Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, which can be utilized to model city objects (e.g., buildings, roads, and automobiles) for creating Digital Twin Cities (DTCs). However, processing such unstructured point clouds is very challenging, epitomized by high cost, movable objects, limited object classes, and high information inadequacy/redundancy. We noticed that many city objects are not in random shapes; rather, they have invariant cross-sections following the Gestalt design principles, including proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and similarity. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised method, called Clustering Of Symmetric Cross-sections of Objects (COSCO), to process urban LiDAR point clouds to a hierarchy of objects based on their characteristic cross-sections. First, city objects are segmented as connected patches of proximate 3D points. Then, symmetric cross-sections are detected for symmetric city objects. Finally, the taxonomy and groups of city objects are recognized from a hierarchical clustering analysis of the dissimilarity matrix. Experimental results showed that COSCO detected the correct taxonomy and types of 12 cars from 24,126 LiDAR points in 8.28 s. Based on the cross-sections and taxonomy, a digital twin was created by registering online free 3D car models in 29.58 s. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an effective unsupervised method for understanding and developing DTC objects in LiDAR point clouds by harnessing innate Gestalt design principles. Secondly, COSCO can be an efficient LiDAR pre-processing tool for recognizing symmetric city objects’ cross-sections, positions, heading directions, dimensions, and possible types for smart city applications in GIScience, Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO), and autonomous vehicles.}

Linear mixed effects modelling resulted in adjusted R2 between 63% and 80% depending on sample size and combinations of contextual data used. Increased daily energy consumption was significantly associated (p-value < 0.05, VIF < 5) with: households living in buildings with more rooms and bedrooms, that are older, more detached, have air-conditioning, and experience colder (more heating degree days) or less sunny weather; households with more adult occupants, more children, older adult occupants, higher heating temperature setpoints, and that do not try to save energy. The results demonstrate the value of smart meter data linked with contextual data for improving understanding of energy demand in British housing. Accredited UK researchers are invited to apply to access the data, which has recently been updated to include over 13,000 households from across Great Britain. This paper provides guidance on appropriate methods to use when analysing the data.}

abstract = {In recent years, the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has increased, resulting in higher demands for sufficient bandwidth, data rates, latency, and quality of service (QoS). In advanced communications, managing network resources for allocating IoT services and identifying the exact IoT devices connected to a network is a major concern. The existing studies have introduced various methods for classifying IoT devices in a network. However, the previous studies faced challenges like limited attributes, low efficiency, inappropriate features, and computational complexities. Also, the existing studies failed to concentrate on IoT/Non-IoT classification along with attack detection. Detecting attacks on IoT devices is critical for making network services more effective. Thus, the proposed study introduces an efficient IoT device classification and attack detection mechanism using software defined networking (SDN)-enabled fiber-wireless access networks internet of things (FiWi IoT) architecture. Initially, an effective resource allocation process is performed to mitigate the delay constraint issues by introducing a hybrid parallel neural network-based dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) method. Then, the input traffic information is gathered from the resource-efficient SDN-enabled FiWi IoT network, and the input data is pre-processed to eliminate unwanted noises using min-max normalization and standardization. Next, the essential attributes are extracted to attain enhanced classification performance. To reduce the feature dimensionality problem and thereby solve complexity issues, the most optimal features are selected by a new chaotic seagull optimization (CSO) approach. After that, IoT/non-IoT classification is performed using a transformer-driven deep intelligent model. Finally, the attacks are detected and classified by introducing a novel slice attention-based deep capsule autoencoder (SA_DCAE) model. For experimentation, the Python 3.7.0 tool is used in this work, and the performance of proposed classifiers is measured by evaluating varied matrices. Also, the comparison analysis proves the superiority of the proposed techniques to other existing methods.}

It is time to formulate an alternative discourse - Urbanisation leading to migration (internal) and security threats in the state. ‘Hyper-Urbanisation’ in the form of ‘Smart Cities’ which involves rapid infrastructural development, and advanced capital investments occasionally becomes drivers for a threat to security. It is essential to look at the relation between Urbanisation and Migration from a security point of view. Urbanisation often leads to the exclusion of the village communities from the national mainstream development program. The exclusion and politicisation of migrants on the religious and political grounds causes resentment, making them anti-establishment. This paper aims to look at the relationship between urbanisation and internal migration and the challenges of health, education, employment, lack of natural resources and security threat. The paper discusses the two theories of Culture of Poverty theory and Social Disorganization theory and elaborates about the challenges that migrants face in the urban spaces causing denial of integration.}

This smart transportation requires to monitor road surfaces precisely and identify hazards, and vehicles also need to share sensing information to avoid dangerous situations or environments through wireless communication in vehicular networks. For this purpose, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) have achieved the international standards of the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE), and applications are now common that use the global positioning systems (GPS) for a dedicated navigation system navigator or smartphone application. This combination of vehicular networking and navigation enables systems and applications not only to enhance driving safety, but also to increase traffic efficiency.

However, previous studies on smart shops have largely focused on the effects of smart technologies on technology adoption rather than customer shopping behaviors. To fill this gap, this study applies the hedonic information systems acceptance model (HISAM) to identify the utilitarian and hedonic motivations affecting consumer shopping intention. In addition, we characterize a second-order formative construct, technology readiness, as a technology-related personality to test its moderating role in the research model in the marketing context when consumer behaviors may differ due to individual characteristics. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we applied SmartPLS 3.2.8 to analyze 298 valid samples. The results show that perceived ease of use significantly affects perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment, in turn, these three factors directly influence shopping intention. Additionally, perceived ease of use will have a stronger impact on perceived usefulness and shopping intention when the customer has a high level of technology readiness. Finally, theoretical and practical suggestions and future research directions are also discussed.}

abstract = {Servitization business models can use performance-based contracts to consider overall life-cycle costs rather than just production costs. However, practical implementation of performance contracts has been limited due to challenges with performance evaluation, accountability, and financial concepts. As a solution, this paper proposes the connection of the digital building twin with blockchain-based smart contracts to execute performance-based digital payments. First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens building twin platform. The resulting prototype is the first full-stack implementation of a performance-based smart contract in the built environment.}

To promote the dispersion of information consumption, China constructed an information consumption demonstration city (ICDC) in 2015; however, the impact of ICDC policies on green city development remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the impact of ICDC policies on city-level carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions. Based on panel data of 204 cities in China from 2010 to 2019, a quasi-experiment method was adopted to evaluate the effects of the ICDC policy on CO2 and SO2 emissions using a difference-in-differences model. The results indicated a significant effect of ICDC policies on green development, reducing urban CO2 and SO2 growth rates by 36% and 31%, respectively. This conclusion was validated using several robustness tests. The mechanism analysis revealed that ICDC policies increased government spending on science and technology, reduced passenger traffic volumes, and promoted the city's digital finance development but had a negative impact on innovative research and development. This study provides novel insights for assessing the externalities of ICDC policies and promoting a city's green and low-carbon development.}

abstract = {Microgrids have recently emerged as a building block for smart grids combining distributed renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage devices, and load management methodologies. The intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges to the smart microgrids, such as reliability, power quality, and balance between supply and demand. Thus, forecasting power generation from RESs, such as wind turbines and solar panels, is becoming essential for the efficient and perpetual operations of the power grid and it also helps in attaining optimal utilization of RESs. Energy demand forecasting is also an integral part of smart microgrids that helps in planning the power generation and energy trading with commercial grid. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models are promising solutions for predicting consumers’ demands and energy generations from RESs. In this context, this manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of the existing DL-based approaches, which are developed for power forecasting of wind turbines and solar panels as well as electric power load forecasting. It also discusses the datasets used to train and test the different DL-based prediction models, enabling future researchers to identify appropriate datasets to use in their work. Even though there are a few related surveys regarding energy management in smart grid applications, they are focused on a specific production application such as either solar or wind. Moreover, none of the surveys review the forecasting schemes for production and load side simultaneously. Finally, previous surveys do not consider the datasets used for forecasting despite their significance in DL-based forecasting approaches. Hence, our survey work is intrinsically different due to its data-centered view, along with presenting DL-based applications for load and energy generation forecasting in both residential and commercial sectors. The comparison of different DL approaches discussed in this manuscript reveals that the efficiency of such forecasting methods is highly dependent on the amount of the historical data and thus a large number of data storage devices and high processing power devices are required to deal with big data. Finally, this study raises several open research problems and opportunities in the area of renewable energy forecasting for smart microgrids.}

abstract = {The global population has rapidly urbanized over the past century, and the urbanization rate is projected to reach about 70% by 2050. In line with these trends and the increasing recognition of the significance of cities in addressing local and global challenges, a lot of research has been published on urban studies and planning since the middle of the twentieth century. While the number of publications has been rapidly increasing over the past decades, there is still a lack of studies analyzing the field's knowledge structure and its evolution. To fill this gap, this study analyzes data related to more than 100,000 articles indexed under the “Urban Studies” and “Regional & Urban Planning” subject categories of the Web of Science. We conduct various analyses such as term co-occurrence, co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and citation analysis to identify the key defining thematic areas of the field and examine how they have evolved. We also identify key authors, journals, references, and organizations that have contributed more to the field's development. The analysis is conducted over five periods: 1956–1975 (the genesis period), 1976–1995 (economic growth and environmentalism), 1996–2015 (sustainable development and technological innovation), 2016–2019 (climate change and SDGs), and 2020 onwards (post-COVID urbanism). Four major thematic areas are identified: 1) socio-economic issues and inequalities, 2) economic growth and innovation, 3) urban ecology and land use planning, and 4) urban policy and governance and sustainability. The first two are recurring themes over different periods, while the latter two have gained currency over the past 2–3 decades following global events and policy frameworks related to global challenges like sustainability and climate change. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, issues related to smart cities, big data analytics, urban resilience, and governance have received particular attention. We found disproportionate contributions to the field from the Global North. Some countries from the Global South with rapid urbanization rates are underrepresented, which may have implications for the future of urbanization. We conclude the study by highlighting thematic gaps and other critical issues that need to be addressed by urban scholars to accelerate the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.}

abstract = {Managing the temperature inside greenhouses is essential for optimum crop growth and the control of diseases and physiological disorders in plants. In large-sized greenhouses, the automatic operation of small-sized multipoint suspension-type heating modules can facilitate better site-specific temperature management by providing favorable uniformity. The objective of this study was to evaluate efficiency of candidate heating modules before the prototype fabrication of a small-sized heating module for smart greenhouses temperature management. Three different heating modules (i.e., finned tubular (FT), fin element positive temperature coefficient (PTCf), and honeycomb positive temperature coefficient (PTCh)) were tested inside a closed chamber (41 m3) and a small greenhouse (98 m3). A wireless sensor network (WSN) was established to monitor the inside environment, operate heating modules, and detect their operational status. In the closed chamber, the PTCf module exhibited a temperature rise rate 8.59% and 7.36% higher than those of the FT and PTCh modules, respectively, while maintaining a superior average temperature variability range of 1.43 – 5.16 (±0.55 – ±0.85) °C. The elapsed times for the three modules were 12.70%, 8.30%, and 10.85% longer than their calculated times, indicating the effectiveness of the heating modules in regulating the environment. During the tests in the small greenhouse, the PTCf module demonstrated a greater average temperature difference between the inside and outside, followed by the FT and PTCh modules. The respective average temperature variability levels inside the greenhouse were recorded as 5.80 – 10.15 (±1.30 – ±2.68) °C, 4.90 – 8.93 (±1.35 – ±2.36) °C, and 4.86 – 9.38 (±1.25 – ±2.35) °C for the three modules. The performance of the PTCf module was better compared to the other two during the experiments in terms of efficiency and maintaining uniformity. However, large-scale field tests with multiple heating modules are required to verify these experimental findings.}

To determine the use of domestic hot water in 918 households located at the study site, new smart meters and peripheral systems were used to collect sub-meter readings of energy/flow/discarded hot water demands and endpoint temperatures every 30 s. Collected data on individual households can provide quantitative information about seasonal changes, variations in hot water service quality among end-users, and end-user behaviors of initial use. Furthermore, statistical and machine learning analyses indicate the possibility of forecasting seasonal domestic hot water consumption through an understanding of the relationship between energy demand and previous outdoor temperatures. Through a clear understanding and with a proper use of the demand behavior as it pertains to domestic hot water, guidelines can be derived to enable the efficient use of domestic hot water by households as well as the efficient operation by heat suppliers.}

abstract = {Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has been widely adopted in today’s mobile devices. However, two types of congestion control algorithms, uncoupled congestion control (Uncoupled CC) and coupled congestion control (Coupled CC), cannot achieve both bottleneck friendliness and throughput maximization for both of the MPTCP subflow bottleneck sharing scenarios, shared bottleneck (SB) scenario and non-shared bottleneck (NSB) scenario, leading to performance degradation in practice. In this work, we seek to enable efficient MPTCP congestion control, by alternating between Uncoupled CC algorithms and Coupled CC algorithms via smartly detecting whether the two MPTCP subflows share the same bottleneck link. We propose SmartSBD, the first learning-based data-driven approach for shared bottleneck detection, which is accurate, adaptable, and easy-to-deploy. SmartSBD is based on the key insight that the properties of subflows that share the same bottleneck often have similar trends of variation or similar values. In the training phase, SmartSBD collects system logs when MPTCP is running in real-world heterogeneous networks, extracts features, and trains a binary classifier. In the runtime phase, SmartSBD makes periodic predictions on the bottleneck sharing condition of live MPTCP subflows, and uses the prediction results to alternate between Coupled CC and Uncoupled CC. Our evaluations demonstrate that SmartSBD outperforms existing approaches.}

Open channel allows various attacks, like replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, fabrication etc., during communication. Also, malicious vehicles can be deployed in the network to misuse or have an unauthorized access to the services. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new remote access control scheme that ensures the secure communication among the vehicles. The vehicles are dynamic in nature in an IoV paradigm, that is, they are not under fixed domains. Therefore, whenever a vehicle changes its location it has to register to the nearest trusted authority (TA) in offline or secured channel mode. To make it applicable, we propose remote registration of the vehicles via the TA. Access control mechanism occurs in two phases: 1) node authentication phase, where vehicles are remotely authenticated by TA and 2) key agreement phase, where after successful mutual authentication they compute a session key by using cryptographic techniques and pre-loaded information. The computed secret session keys are used for ensuring secure communications in future between two vehicles in a cluster as well. Informal security analysis along with formal security verification using the broadly-used Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) show that our access control scheme is secured against various potential attacks. We also show the competency of our scheme by comparing it with other existing schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.}

Based on the results of comparison (through simulation) between the effects of reducing the temperature and cooling load on the cladding material, exterior shading, and fan and pad evaporative cooling system in smart farms in the UAE, the capacity of refrigerators and thermal storage tanks in greenhouses can be determined. Moreover, the peak cooling load according to the cladding material type, shading rate, and use of fan and pad was analyzed. When an exterior shading rate and fan and pad system efficiency of 50% and 90%, respectively, were applied to poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), the peak cooling load decreased by 87.9% in comparison to when a general polyolefin (PO) film was applied.}

Instead, each vehicle can be charged smartly just based on its demand for its next trips. In this way, charging takes less time and the total consumption is balanced without any discomfort for the drivers. To implement this smart method, electric vehicle owners must fill in an information sheet that contains the number and lengths of the their next. Then, its required energy is calculated this info, and the initial battery state of charge. Finally, the charging management system starts the planning according to its upstream distribution system operator. Several parameters are needed for the planning such as time of use tariff of the electricity, the distribution transformer or substation physical limits, the rate of the charge (normal or fast), etc. The aim of the planning is to minimize the charging cost considering the technical and economic constraints. Here, the YALMIP and MOSEK software are used as the solver of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model.}

The most time-honored and prominent concept is the “sustainable city,” which is depicted as a model urban form and thereafter more city concepts have come into being. However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance, “eco-cities,” “smart city,” “sustainable city,” and “resilient city,” what are the underpinning building blocks within each concept and how these concepts correlate with each other. This bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive summary, a clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city concepts, by establishing a co-word matrix of high-frequency keywords occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition of each city concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also investigated are the correlations between the city concepts with a statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that overlap or connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown that, under the two umbrella terms of “sustainable city” and “smart city,” the “? -city” literature has developed in a variety of distinctive ways.}

abstract = {This exploration aims to improve the measurement accuracy of the electric energy meter under dynamic load conditions, and try to minimize the dynamic error. With the popularization of energy-saving and environmental protection concepts, exploring the dynamic power error of electric meters in the electric field becomes the basis for the reliable, economical, and efficient operation of smart grids. According to the actual dynamic load working mode in the electric power field, a Ternary Amplitude Shift Keying (TASK) dynamic test current and dynamic test power model are designed. Then, a test system for smart meter dynamic error is constructed based on the TASK algorithm and the model designed above. Furthermore, different sample meters are used to simulate and analyze the dynamic power error test performance of the error test system. The unidirectional dynamic power error of each sample meter is analyzed. Results demonstrate that the unidirectional power error of the foreign factory's sample meter is less than 0.2% when the test current is 2.5A. The bi-directional power analysis suggests that only the dynamic error of the foreign factory's sample meter is within the error range of 0.2%. The construction scheme of the dynamic error test system for electric energy meters is achieved to solve the dynamic error test problem under the bidirectional power test model oriented to time process. This system provides the basis for the development of the power field.}

abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) is a key concept for digitization in the Industry 4.0. Two main elements of this concept are simulation and modeling since it allows engineers to have a digital representation of the system as well as enables them to test new configurations without changing the running system. Simulation of a real-world environment can be a challenge because it involves many different entities and variables. For example, in a smart city scenario, there might exist services that people can use for transportation, healthcare, delivery, energy supply, and so on. Creating this kind of scenario can be difficult since not all data is digitally available, and its digitalization might not be possible to be done. In this context, having a virtual environment capable of emulating the main components is an important piece for building these applications, not only to simulate new scenarios but also to prototype initial concepts. This paper proposes the use of Node-RED and Carla simulators to provide a platform witch DT-based systems can be model and simulated. The focus of this approach is to provide a concept that reduces the gap between models and real-world applications as well as connecting virtual representations to real-world applications keeping all parts synchronized. A use case of a Car-asa-Service (CaaS) system has been implemented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed concept.}

Given that there are no publicly available large-scale residential electric smart meter data sets with detailed building characteristics, an open-source virtual smart meter (VSM) data set is used. The VSM data consists of electricity consumption profiles for 200,000 homes with 21 known characteristics, which are used to train predictive models with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification accuracy (CA) is determined for a variety of scenarios where the meter data aggregation and period are varied. The CA depends on the parameter to be classified (the class), the number of data points per building (the features) and the number of buildings used for classification. Reliable classification results are obtained when the number of buildings exceeds the number of features by a significant margin. An application of the developed predictive models to a small data set of 30 real houses illustrates the usefulness of the method but also the challenges in achieving a generalized model with virtual data.}

Besides, SAAS-SG ensures the integrity and confidentiality of AKE messages while preserving the anonymity of SMs and SPR. Besides, for encrypted transmission in the future, SAAS-SG empowers SMs and SPR to set up an analogous secret session key (SK) after performing the mutual authentication. SK encrypts the sensitive information exchanged between SMs and service providers (SPR) over the public Internet. Moreover, we illustrate that SAAS-SG is capable of resisting different security vulnerabilities by conducting informal and Scyther-based security analyses. In addition, the random oracle model is operated to validate the security of the established secret SK. Furthermore, comparing SAAS-SG with other related AKE schemes explicates that SAAS-SG requires low communication, storage, and computational overheads, respectively, while accomplishing the AKE phase and renders enhanced security features.}

Moreover, a section details the aspects of achieving hourly balance in the future power supply as well as stabilization in the power grid. To identify the best solutions, it is crucial to include the entire energy system; not only to include all demands, but also to enable an analysis of the links within the energy system, between the grids.

Today, the smart building and socially resilient city concepts have been introduced where building automation technologies are implemented to manage and control the energy generation/consumption/storage. Building automation and control systems can be roughly classified into traditional and advanced control strategies. Traditional strategies are not a viable choice for more sophisticated features required in smart buildings. The main focus of this paper is to review advanced control strategies and their impact on buildings and technical systems with respect to energy/cost saving. These strategies should be predictive/responsive/adaptive against weather, user, grid and thermal mass. In this context, special attention is paid to model predictive control and adaptive control strategies. Although model predictive control is the most common type used in buildings, it is not well suited for systems consisting of uncertainties and unpredictable data. Thus, adaptive predictive control strategies are being developed to address these shortcomings. Despite great progress in this field, the quantified results of these strategies reported in literature showed a high level of inconsistency. This is due to the application of different control modes, various boundary conditions, hypotheses, fields of application, and type of energy consumption in different studies. Thus, this review assesses the implementations and configurations of advanced control solutions and highlights research gaps in this field that need further investigations.}

First, a Cox proportional hazard model is fitted to data from public transport smart cards to identify the “at risk” users, where the risk is identified based on a consecutive reduction of public transport use. This allows us to distinguish changes in the frequency (i.e., lasting reductions of public transport use) from variations of the frequency (i.e., temporal fluctuation of public transport use) in a coarse but simple manner. Second, we develop a set of indicators to characterize the passengers’ travel patterns, allowing us to make policy implications for promoting public transport use. In an empirical analysis, the impact of a reduction in tram frequency by public transport authorities on usage of transport services is initially examined using the model and is found not to have any significant short-term effects. Factors affecting public transport use are then identified and discussed. Based on the analysis, suggestions are made to encourage use of public transport in rural cities by selected demographics and travel patterns.}

This paper proposes a smart traffic management (STM) framework that combines the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and game theory to manage traffic loads at road intersections. The intersection is considered a non-cooperative game, where traffic flow for each route is determined by the Nash Equilibrium (NE) to ensure that no individual can improve their performance by changing their strategy. In severe congestion, many players/vehicles significantly affect the strategy selection process. To address this, we adopt an agent-representative approach, using spectral clustering to group players with the same strategies and payoff. The proposed STM is compared with other schemes, i.e., the conventional approach without NE and SmartRoute. Our STM significantly outperformed existing protocols, reducing intersection traffic intensity by 30% and average waiting time by 40%, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing traffic loads at uncontrolled intersections.}

To let the data reveal how preferences are distributed in the population, a logit-mixed logit model in willingness-to-pay space and a combination of observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity was specified and fitted. Results show that residents of Tompkins County are willing to pay more than in other counties for residential storage, and that for home energy management there is an important generational divide with millennials being much more likely to perceive the economic value in the smart energy technologies. The flexible logit-mixed logit estimates provide evidence of important heterogeneity in preferences: whereas most of the population has a positive—albeit rather low—valuation of smart energy products and services, there is a considerable percentage of customers with negative perceptions.}

abstract = {Ambient Intelligence is an emerging technology that allows for reasoning of activities that are carried out in a smart environment. Smart sensors play a vital role in activity recognition tasks. Though a great number of sensors provide more pinpointed information about where and when the interaction in the environment occurred, addition of sensors also results in higher power consumption and greater cost constraints. The number of training samples used for activity recognition tasks also increases and becomes computationally expensive. Thus, to overcome these constraints sensor optimization in smart environment is carried out. Mapping of sensors to a user's activity becomes tedious when more than one activity is carried out at the same timestamp. Unambiguous sensor-activity relationship is derived with the help of spatial and temporal context represented by ontology model that captures real time sensor data. Since there exits spatial noise during activity annotation process, it is eliminated with help of pointwise mutual information score. Spatial and temporal data of an activity helps sensor optimization in multi resident living with concurrent activity occurrence. Inactive sensors are removed using mutual information score and redundant sensors are contextually paired based on where an activity happens. By doing so, only unique set of sensors are paired every time even when concurrent activity occurs. The quality of features derived is tested by testing the accuracy of the model by activity recognition task using Random Forest algorithm. Nearly 24% of sensors were identified as inactive in the smart environment. The accuracy of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task remained constant even after removing the inactive sensors. Addition of spatial context helped to improve HAR with increased accuracy. Contextual pairing of redundant sensors resulted in minimal drop in the model's accuracy.}

However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource.}

abstract = {As part of the post-2015 United Nations sustainable development agenda, the world has its first urban sustainable development goal (USDG) “to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. This paper provides an overview of the USDG and explores some of the difficulties around using this goal as a tool for improving cities. We argue that challenges emerge around selecting the indicators in the first place and also around the practical use of these indicators once selected. Three main practical problems of indicator use include 1) the poor availability of standardized, open and comparable data 2) the lack of strong data collection institutions at the city scale to support monitoring for the USDG and 3) “localization” - the uptake and context specific application of the goal by diverse actors in widely different cities. Adding to the complexity, the USDG conversation is taking place at the same time as the proliferation of a bewildering array of indicator systems at different scales. Prompted by technological change, debates on the “data revolution” and “smart city” also have direct bearing on the USDG. We argue that despite these many complexities and challenges, the USDG framework has the potential to encourage and guide needed reforms in our cities but only if anchored in local institutions and initiatives informed by open, inclusive and contextually sensitive data collection and monitoring.}

abstract = {This paper examines the diverse ways in which science and technology are implicated in collective imaginations of urban futures in Kenya. Despite calls for a ‘deep reimagining’ of African urbanisation (UN Habitat 2014), globalised narratives of urban ‘smartness’ are intersecting with pan-African tendencies toward top-down Master Planning to constrain spaces for collective imagining of urban futures. Using the conceptual lens of sociotechnical imaginaries and the methodological approach of Q method, we hope to open up and navigate the space of tension between the violence of narratives of failure and crisis in African cities, and the sometimes ‘blinding power’ of certain hyper-modernist visions of urban futures. We argue that powerful global hegemonic forces around urban transformation can sometimes be most effectively balanced, not by reproducing the same assertive idiom of stylised monothetic categories and set-piece contrasts but by illuminating diversity in the implicated imaginations. Our research describes three distinguishable overlapping imaginaries of Kenya urban futures, which we call: ‘Working towards equitable, culturally-vibrant urban habitats for all’; ‘Transforming our cities and ourselves to become ‘smarter’ and thrive sustainability in a digital future’, and ‘Pragmatically harnessing technology for more inclusive, equitable, liveable cities’. Our findings highlight salient dimensions of difference between the imaginaries including: diverse understandings of technology and culture in urban areas; diverse imaginaries of the urban dwellers of the future; and diverse imagined processes of change. Through detailed analysis of the distinctiveness and similarities/overlap between these imaginaries, we draw out implications for urban governance in Kenya.}

The challenge is on technology and on service transformation and improvement, and transparency of impacts for improving operational efficiency. Improving service quality requires participatory and synergetic processes that attract extra attention to the social and management aspects of the built environment. The more values a service contains, the better users engage with them. Facility Management (FM) has the required potential to fill this gap as management is a people-centre discipline. This requires the central involvement of FM in the planning and decision-making processes, therefore its role and impact should be enlarged and better communicated. This paper is evidence-based research, which shows how FM can extend its impact on the build environment and society by bringing the socio-physiological aspect and the community in the central of the planning and design process. It also shows the trend to serve a various group of residents, by developing smart and simple solutions. The communication between FM and people should be interactive and iterative, in which they both define problems/needs and co-create the relevant solutions.}

Since the appearance of the wireless connectivity, architecture, and urban design began to take another dimension in the design process to adopt the new technology and integrated it within its envelope. At the beginning of the 21st century, new approaches began to take place in the city, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and, more recently, the 4G and 5G wireless technology. However, the effectiveness of these advanced technologies depends on both the wireless signal coverage and the deployment of their equipment. In this context, these technologies impose a new challenge for architects, urban designers, and the construction industry to embrace them within the concept of the smart city. This study focuses on the analysis of 5G technology and highlighting its advantages and disadvantages, which impact the visual appearance and aesthetics of both buildings and the city. The study also intends to explore the various possible solutions to overcome the predicament of the wireless signal coverage and the penetration of buildings. However, this research aims to define a set of recommendations for the construction industry to take further innovative steps towards achieving advanced building materials that can adopt the 5G technology.}

The intervention linked NO2 levels with the cycle time of the traffic lights. When NO2 levels exceeded a certain threshold, the strategy was triggered, which reduced the traffic congestion by turning the traffic lights green. Eight Earthsense Zephyrs air quality sensors and nine inductive-loop traffic detectors were installed in Thatcham to simultaneously monitor the air quality and traffic flows, respectively. Compared to the pre-intervention period, the observed NO2 concentrations decreased in June, July and August and increased in September 2021, however, this does not reveal the true effect of smart traffic intervention. Using the observed data on the days with- and without-exceedances, we developed two machine learning models to predict the Business-as-usual (BAU) air quality level, i.e., a generalised additive model for average concentration and a quantile regression model for peak concentration. Our results demonstrated that average predicted concentrations (BAU) were lower than the observed concentrations (with intervention) by 12.45 %. However, we found that peak concentrations decreased by 20.54 %.}

Efficient energy use and occupant comfort are paramount considerations in building design and operation. To address these challenges, this study introduces a predictive model leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The model aims to predict thermal comfort levels and optimize energy consumption in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Four distinct ML algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) are employed for this purpose. Data for the model is collected using a network of Raspberry Pi boards equipped with multiple sensors. Performance evaluation of the ML algorithms is conducted using statistical error metrics, including, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Results reveal that the RF and XGBOOST algorithms exhibit superior performance, achieving accuracies of 96.7 % and 9.64 % respectively. In contrast, the SVM algorithm demonstrates inferior performance with a R2 of 81.1 %. These findings underscore the predictive capability of the RF and XGBOOST model in forecasting Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values. The proposed model holds promise for enhancing occupant thermal comfort in buildings while simultaneously optimizing energy consumption in HVAC systems. Further research could explore the practical applications of these findings in building design and operation.}

This new model is exemplified in this paper with a use case in the urban domain, the Cites Standards Institute (CSI 2.0). The CSI 2.0 is a pioneering format of standardisation group consisting of the partnership between a formal standards body, the British Standards Institution (BSI) and an urban innovation centre, Future Cities Catapult (FCC), both UK-based organisations. The CSI 2.0 uses the intelligenter principles to develop more user-driven and participatory-led standards development process. The Intelligenter Method principles consist of the creation of a collaboratory based on multi-stakeholder collaborations in an integrated multi-subsystems physical environment and have been successfully implemented so far in the intelligenter making of plans and projects (I) and in the drafting of policies and regulations (II). This paper presents how these collaboratories can help in the development of intelligenter standards and standardisation instruments (III).}

Firstly, the ICH of Chongqing is sorted out and classified. The ICH-related APP interfaces in the market are analyzed through investigation. Secondly, an image recognition algorithm of ICH based on deep learning (DL) technology is proposed and applied in APP to realize automatic recognition and introduction of ICH. Finally, a set of APP interface interaction design schemes is designed based on user habits and visual feelings to enhance user experience. The experimental results reveal: (1) The model for recognizing ICH images using the convolutional neural network (CNN) has higher recognition accuracy, recall, and F1 value than the model without CNNs; (2) After incorporating transfer learning (TL) into the model, the recognition accuracy, recall, and F1 value of the model have further improved; (3) The survey results show that the Chongqing ICH APP interface system based on DL technology, user habits, and visual perception performs better in terms of user experience, usability, and other aspects. This study aims to design an APP interface system for the Chongqing ICH based on DL technology, user habits, and visual perception, to improve user experience and usability.

Urban sensors with different uses vary greatly in hardware structure, communication protocols, data formats, interaction modes, sampling frequencies, data accuracy and service quality, thus posing an enormous challenge to the unified integration and sharing of massive sensor information resources. Consequently, access and data management methods for these multisource heterogeneous urban sensors are extremely important. Additionally, multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access and data management technologies provide strong support for intelligent perception and scientific management at the city scale and can accelerate the construction of smart cities or digital twin cities with virtual reality features. We systematically summarize the related research on these technologies. First, we present a summary of the concepts and applications of urban sensors. Then, the research progress on multisource heterogeneous urban sensor access technologies is analysed in relation to communication protocols, data transmission formats, access standards, access technologies and data transmission technologies. Subsequently, the data management technologies for urban sensors are reviewed from the perspectives of data cleaning, data compression, data storage, data indexing and data querying. In addition, the challenges faced by the technologies above and corresponding feasible solutions are discussed from three aspects, namely, the integration of massive Internet of Things (IoT), computational burden and energy consumption and cybersecurity.

This paper discusses the risks of ITS implementation by analyzing the current state, identifying the key risk factors and showing possibilities in reduction of these risk using system methodology. It can be assumed that this transformation will be time-consuming, not only in policy and construction areas, but also in putting these systems into operation. In this meantime, when smart and non-smart systems will come in contact, there should be expected risk situations, that could cause difficulties for large-scale ITS to emerge, for example for large cities. An important part is also early awareness of the population which is affected by the situation of putting the system into operation, especially trainings for professional drivers. A participant in traffic, who are not affected by smart technologies as so-called “internet generation“ should be taken into account, as possible source of risk situations. Determining the potential risks on all the above-mentioned case is a current problem because of the rapid development and onset of ITS.}

Proper diagnose upon the healthy status of cities requires a set of scientific and rigorous city health diagnose toolkits. With regard to city health diagnosis, extant studies have proposed various indicators. Whilst the diagnosis indicators appear to be fragmented and lack an organism perspective in investigating urban health status. This study thus fulfills the gap of existing literature by treating cities as living organisms and establish a conceptual framework of city living organism, which is composed by five aspects of living characteristics, including metabolism, response, adaptivity, growth, and reproduction. Based on the city organism framework, a set of city somatic index system is proposed, and detailed guidance upon how to use this set of index system to conduct city health diagnose is provided. City health diagnosis in referring to the established conceptual framework and index system can be undertaken at three levels: macro, meso and micro. The validity of the established city health diagnosis framework is tested via a case study of 12 Chinese cities. The city organism framework and city health diagnose index system provide a scientific toolkit for city managers and researchers to systematically investigate city health status and address any underlying urban diseases.}

However, because each IoT platform is based on a different resource identifier (ID), it is difficult to identify each device and use the service among heterogeneous IoT platforms. To solve this problem, we propose an interoperability framework that includes an IoT resource name system (RNS) based on analysis of the resource IDs (i.e., device ID and resource request formats) of five selected IoT platforms: oneM2M, Oliot, Watson IoT, IoTivity, and FIWARE. The IoT RNS converts a specific resource path into a resource request format for each platform. The converted resource path is shared among IoT RNSs for each platform, and users can request services from other platforms using converted resource paths. We also present an example of interoperability scenario among heterogeneous IoT platforms using the proposed IoT RNS in a smart city. The scenario includes each stage, such as resource registration and deletion, sharing mapping tables, converting resource addresses, and service requests. Furthermore, to prove the aims of the proposed approach, we implemented the resource interoperability scenario between oneM2M and FIWARE. In the experiments, resources can interwork in the two platforms through resource path conversion. Based on the results, we performed a qualitative evaluation of the IoT RNS with the current studies. In conclusion, our proposal overcomes the issues of building an existing integrated platform or specific central ontology and duplicating resources inside the platform. In addition, we separate the functions of the root and local IoT RNSs to solve communication traffic and memory capability issues.}

By applying sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing on tweets from the two countries over the last decade (2010 to end of 2019), we found that the sustainability awareness in Germany is higher than the US. We see that the US is at an earlier sustainability maturity state, creating fertile grounds for establishing sustainability policies on time to shape public opinion. Furthermore, we find that after the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the overall awareness in both countries has increased, showing the potential of such policies. In addition, in contrast to expectations, we see that the smart meter privacy concerns have recently started to deteriorate, possibly as a result of governmental efforts to educate the public about smart meter technology. Finally, we see that the German public tweets more positively about e-mobility, compared to the US, whereas the content of e-mobility discussions differs: Germany is more concerned about e-mobility adoption, whereas the US is more focused on battery efficiency and other technological developments associated with e-mobility.}

The incorporation of distributed renewable energy system has initiated an acute transition from the traditional centralized energy management system to independent demand responsive energy systems. Renewable energy-based Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMSs) play a vital role in the residential sector with the increased and dynamic electricity demand during the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance the efficacy, sustainability, economical benefits, and energy conservation for a distribution system. In this regard, the reviews of various energy management schemes for smart homes appliances and associated challenges has been presented. Different energy scheduling controller techniques have also been analyzed and compared in the COVID-19 framework by reviewing several cases from the literature. The utilization and benefits of renewable-based SHEMS have also been discussed. In addition, both micro and macro-level socio-economic implications of COVID-19 on SHEMSs are discussed. A conclusion has been drawn given the strengths and limitations of different energy scheduling controllers and optimization techniques in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is observed that renewable-energy-based SHEMS with improved multi-objective meta-heuristic optimization algorithms employing artificial intelligence are better suited to deal with the dynamic residential energy demand in the pandemic. It is hoped that this review, as a fundamental platform, will facilitate the researchers aiming to investigate the performance of energy management and demand response schemes for further improvement, especially during the pandemic.}

abstract = {Occupancy information in indoor spaces is playing an increasingly important role in the development of smart applications. The need for this type of information covers a multitude of domains in the Smart Buildings paradigm such as improving energy saving or occupant comfort. For this reason, we can find many works in the literature focused on occupancy tracking/monitoring using solutions based on RGB cameras and computer vision techniques, sensors and machine learning techniques, or air quality control, among others. But these solutions have limitations. Some of them do not support the tracking of people between spaces, the time to update information is too long, or the system used is too intrusive. This paper presents a solution to estimate the occupancy level in indoor spaces of different areas through depth cameras. This approach also proposes the integration of neural networks to deal with situations where the data collected from the environment is incomplete, filling the gaps caused by occlusion or performance problems. Finally, an occupancy service has been designed and deployed in order to provide occupancy information to other applications, such as evacuation services. The experiments carried out show how it is possible to obtain an accuracy of 90.20% through this approximation. In addition, we face some of the limitations mentioned above: the solution allows tracking movement and occupancy in large spaces without (1) lighting dependencies and (2) the requirement for users to wear devices. This, and the high accuracy obtained make the proposed work a great alternative for occupancy estimation in indoor spaces.}

The uncertainties of electric load, market price, and renewable energy resources as well as voltage dependent load model, are well incorporated into the problem. Also, for evaluation of the different strategies, the planning is performed considering risk-neutral vs. risk-averse DisCos. Simulations are performed on a large-scale distribution network of 138-node. Results showed that by taking a risk-averse strategy, the penetration level of the DGs and BESSs in the expanded network, is increased from 20% to 26%.}

With insights from the case of Ghana, we introduce an affordance constraints process as a framework to complement the existing affordance actualisation process framework in information systems. Thus, this study contributes to affordance theory with a new constraints process. The study’s findings show that smart service systems for seaport security afford autonomous access control, real-time security monitoring, and autonomous data capturing for analytics and reporting. However, such affordances can be constrained by power and internet outages, limited storage capacity, and device breakdowns.

The growth of cities caused a reduction in the average speed of vehicles, increasing the pollutant gas emissions, the average traveling time of inhabitants and commodities, directly affecting various sectors of the economy. One viable solution to minimize problems caused by traffic is based on the concept of Car2X-Communication. The Car2X-Communication infrastructure is the first step to implement Smart Cities technological solutions for road safety. However, to support this new network it is necessary to implement a new physical infrastructure, consisting of cables, sensors and many types of devices. The objective of this project is to design the necessary infrastructure to implement solutions based on smart cities to cover the public transportation system of Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. The proposal is based on the Internet of Things infrastructure, following the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.}

abstract = {Thermal properties have significant impact on ecological footprint and life-cycle assessment of buildings. This is even more crucial aspect for glass buildings, which have been criticised as major factors in climate change around the world. Recent debates on glass facades, which culminated in plans for a “glass building ban” in New York City highlighted the importance of innovation in glass construction. The current solutions for mitigating energy consumption for glass facades are improving insulation (U-value) and solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) with advanced glazing or using shading devices. A fourth approach is the recent technology of water-filled glass (WFG), which utilizes water layer to improve thermal comfort and energy performance of the façade. This paper introduces Smart Water-filled Glass (SWFG) control method, which enables the change of the opacity of the façade element by colouring the fluid over a year regarding seasonal changes. The impact of changing transparency of water layer on cooling and heating energy demand is evaluated by simulating and analysing the energy performance of a reference office room with large glazing facade in different climates. The significance of this energy evaluation is that a water-filled glass with switchable transparency is simulated and assessed here for the first time. The paper analyses the performance in seven cities from all relevant major climatic regions using LBNL WINDOW and TRNSYS (v.18) As a novel approach, the simulation study makes it possible to evaluate the overall performance of two proposed operational methods (insolation-based & storage-based) for adjusting water layer settings depending on climate conditions and reusability of the captured heat in water layer. Moreover, seven different base cases are presented in this study to compare the performance of proposed system, including conventional solutions (e.g. double or triple glazing with/without shading) and a state-of-the-art switchable technology (e.g. electrochromic glazing or EC). The results verify the hypothesis that the impact of SWFG compared to WFG varies depending on the climate with 0%-5.28% for hot climates and 0.25–3.39% for climates with heating demand. The discussion includes comparison with standard glass facades, where SWFG shows 47.41%-78.01% energy savings depending on climate. The climate-based approach of SWFG and WFG offers a significant shift in façade design that sees glass buildings as an opportunity for sustainability rather than liability for climate change.}

The purpose of this study is to report how private rainwater-retention/harvesting tools/facilities can be spread gradually but steadily in the city, as a smart way to responding to urban flood-disaster risks. Rainwater harvesting tanks (0.2 m3) were installed intensively in 2010 and a rainwater harvesting house (42 m3) was constructed in 2012 in the city of Fukuoka, Japan after the city experienced a flood disaster in 2009. The former enhanced users’ daily preparedness for emergency, and the latter inspired construction of a rainwater-harvesting housing complex (108m3) in an adjacent city. An elementary school is under construction from November of 2014 by another, nearby municipality inspired by these facilities. The school premises are located on the land reclaimed from an old irrigation pond. Thus the school needs to be adapted to this condition. 3,800 m3 of rainwater can be retained within the school premises. The water is used to flush the toilet and water flowers to be grown by pupils. The amounts of retention and discharge will be monitored, and the data will be utilized for science education. In big cities, people tend to depend too much on the top-down, mega-system involving dredging rivers, strengthening drainage systems, constructing flood walls, etc., which invites more man-made, impervious surfaces in urban areas. Bottom-up, individual and/or collaborative approaches should be adopted in order to achieve multiple purposes of preventing/mitigating disasters, preserving/conserving ecosystems and nurturing/rebuilding communities in the city.}

abstract = {Population increase and the adoption of new power appliances have significantly increased electrical demands. As a result, the utility (electricity supplier) faces difficulties in maintaining the balance between supply and demand. Further, such supply and demand imbalance leads to frequent load-shedding and a drop in power quality (PQ), predominantly in the developing world. Increasing consumer awareness of energy consumption and implementing efficient demand-side management (DSM) algorithms in a metering instrument can be utilized to avoid such issues. Nowadays, access to the internet in developing nations is increasing rapidly. Hence to solve the existing limitations, the internet of things (IoT)-based smart meter (SM) is proposed and its practical application demonstrated in households in Bangladesh as a case study. The proposed SM primarily serves local and online monitoring, bidirectional data transmission, and DSM at the consumer side by maintaining PQ and peak-clipping. The MySql cloud database is used here for data storage and bidirectional data transmission between consumers and the utility. Web applications are developed for real-time data visualization, enabling consumers to track their hourly, daily, and monthly energy consumption by accessing the web page. The SM data shows that the over-voltage varied (from a nominal 220 V) within 15.45–16.36%, and the under-voltage varied between 10.45% and 11.82% from 220 V. The frequency fluctuations are found to be 2.2% under and 2.4% over the nominal value of 50 Hz (standard is nominal value ± 1%). The experimental result showed that the proposed IoT-based SM could ensure the smooth operation of electrical home appliances by maintaining PQ-related parameters (voltage and frequency) within a standard limit. Additionally, the proposed SM also helps to maintain the maximum pre-defined demand of a household during peak times through an appropriate load-clipping algorithm. The utility company can remotely define peak time hours and maximum peak demands when necessary. The real-life demonstration of the SM's operation advocated that this type of IoT-based SM could be easily adapted to maintain the balance between supply and demand through DSM application, and increase consumers' awareness of energy consumption in developing countries.}

The wind energy generated at the level of distributed generation also reduces the impact on the transmission system in terms of loss in the line and improves the efficiency of the power system. The increase in the level of penetration of wind power generation into an island power system network, causing severe threat in the system in terms of protection and security. The decrease in system inertia by means of increasing in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) causes an impact on the stability of the system and further may lead to a blackout of the system. The protection and control of this system are becoming more complicated due to the penetration of RES into the system. So in order to solve these issues, an intelligent control technique is implemented between the robust energy storage system and wind energy system. The Load Frequency Control (LFC) is required to emulate the virtual inertia into the island power system to stabilize the frequency variations and power variations. Furthermore, a digital frequency relay is implemented to protect the system from large power fluctuations for longer duration and a security system is implemented for protecting the whole island system from cyber-attacks. To verify the effectiveness of controller as well as protection system robustness, it is tested for different load disturbances and by increasing the penetration level of wind power, the digital relay has been tested for large frequency variation in the system by using MATLAB/Simulink.}

abstract = {This study introduces a novel flood monitoring and warning system (FMWS) that leverages the capabilities of long-range wide area networks (LoRaWAN) to maintain extensive network connectivity, consume minimal power, and utilize low data transmission rates. We developed a new algorithm to measure and monitor flood levels and rate changes effectively. The innovative, cost-effective, and user-friendly FMWS employs an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino microcontroller to measure flood levels and determine their status. Real-time data regarding flood levels and associated risk levels (safe, alert, cautious, or dangerous) are updated on The Things Network and integrated into TagoIO and ThingSpeak IoT platforms through a custom-built LoRaWAN gateway. The solar-powered system functions as a stand-alone beacon, notifying individuals and authorities of changing conditions. Consequently, the proposed LoRaWAN-based FMWS gathers information from catchment areas according to water level risks, triggering early flood warnings and sending them to authorities and residents via the mobile application and multiple web-based dashboards for proactive measures. The system's effectiveness and functionality are demonstrated through real-life implementation. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of the LoRa/LoRaWAN communication interface in terms of RSSI, SNR, PDR, and delay for two spreading factors (SF7 and SF12). The system's design allows for future expansion, enabling simultaneous data reporting from multiple sensor monitoring units to a server via a central gateway as a network.}

abstract = {With this commentary, we share our reflections at the end of a five-year interdisciplinary research project (from 2016 to 2020) on cycling innovations in living labs across the Netherlands. The commentary is the product of a collective writing effort of the researchers. It combines reflections on both the content of our research project (cycling through the lens of innovations) from various disciplinary perspectives – including socio-technical transitions, mobilities, urban design, transport planning and history – and reflections on the transdisciplinary approach (living labs) underpinning our research. We hope that our reflections can benefit other researchers concerned with similar topics and approaches. Our research project, Smart Cycling Futures (SCF), began as a proposal within the Smart Urban Regions of the Future (SURF) program, funded by the Dutch Council for Academic Research (NWO). This call of €16.5 million was co-financed by the Dutch Ministries of Infrastructure & Environment and Internal Affairs. As one of the five winning consortia – the other consortia focused on self-driving cars, influencing travel behaviour, demand-oriented public transport, and small-scale experiments – our group of mobility-oriented researchers played an active role in shaping the evolving landscape of smart mobility innovation in the Netherlands.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the focus of enterprises is gradually expanding from product manufacturing system to Product service system (PSS). In the existing research, scholars mainly focus on the in-depth study of a certain method or technology, and the research on traditional PSS is relatively mature. In addition, it is a tendency that transform towards SPLSS with the characteristics of industrial internet platform (IIP) and sustainable operation theory. Based on this, this paper explores the research path from traditional product service system (PSS) to smart product service system (SPSS), and then to smart product lifecycle service system (SPLSS), which can endow the products with intelligent perception, intelligent analysis and intelligent decision-making capabilities based on Industrial Internet Platform (IIP). A reference model of IIP enabled SPLSS for industrial services based on system engineering method and theory from a very detailed practical investigation is proposed. Moreover, on the basis of this model, its three dimensional subsystems are expanded, including: supporting environment subsystem, evolution path subsystem, and added value subsystem. The study can provide a reference for the enterprise's manufacturing strategy and manufacturing path. It will promote the transformation and upgrading of enterprise manufacturing model to improve service efficiency and reduce operating costs, and then realize the value-added of products and services.}
