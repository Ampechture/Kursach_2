abstract = {Radiative cooling (RC) is a technique that spontaneously radiates long-wave infrared (LWIR) to the cold outer space, which provides cooling power to buildings, however only preferred in hot seasons. RC has been widely researched on walls and roofs but rarely on windows while windows are the least energy-efficient part of buildings. Moreover, in the current smart window design, consideration of tunable RC is missing. For the first time, we proposed an ideal smart window with a switchable front side LWIR emissivity (εFront) and solar modulation ability (ΔTsol). Such window needs not only to have high luminous transmission (Tlum) and ΔTsol, the two major conventional performance indexes but also possess a switchable εFront to cater for the variable seasonal thermal performance requirements and energy-saving demands. We further fabricated a tunable emissivity thermochromic (TET) smart window with large ΔTsol (51%) and Tlum (72%) and switchable εFront (0.95–0.1) to prove the efficacy of the proposed ideal window. Compared with current smart window technology solely regulating solar transmission and other RC materials with fixed emissivity, the TET smart window panel gives a wide tunability in the selective solar spectrum for dynamic climate conditions in energy-saving buildings, achieving largely enhanced energy saving performance globally}

Infrastructure systems provide the basis for everyday life and enable the flow of goods, information, and services within urban and regional settings. Providing data-centric solutions to improve this flow is essential. This can only be achieved if we manage to transform passive infrastructure assets into cyber-physical systems. Digital twins bring the opportunity to turn passive infrastructure assets into data-centric systems of systems. This article aims to provide a summary of existing digital twin architectures and exemplify a digital twin design and implementation. To this end, a literature review of digital twin architecture is presented in addition to a case study of a digital twin implementation in smart infrastructure. The case study focuses on a digital twin implementation of a bridge and describes in detail the physical, cyber, integration, and service layers of this implementation. Later in the article, we discuss the learnings from this case study under three main categories – systems perspective, information perspective, and organisational perspective. The findings show the importance of acquiring a systems perspective when designing digital twins today to enable interoperable systems of systems in the future. Furthermore, the findings highlight the vital necessity of data and information management while also considering the multidisciplinary aspects of digital twin design and implementation.}

What are the varying economic, governance, and energy and climate sustainability aspects associated with the diffusion of smart meters for electricity? What lessons can be learned from the ongoing rollouts of smart meters around the world? Based on an original dataset twice as comprehensive as the current state of the art, this study examines smart meter deployment across 41 national programs and 61 subnational programs that collectively target 1.49 billion installations involving 47 countries. In addition to rates of adoption and the relative influence of factors such as technology costs, we examine adoption requirements, modes of information provision, patterns of incumbency and management, behavioral changes and energy savings, emissions reductions, policies, and links to other low-carbon transitions such as energy efficiency or renewable energy. We identify numerous weak spots in the literature, notably the lack of harmonized datasets as well as inconsistent scope and quality within national cost-benefit analyses of smart meter programs. Most smart meters have a lifetime of only 20 years, leading to future challenges concerning repair, care, and waste. National-scale programs (notably China) account for a far larger number of installations than subnational ones, and national scale programs also install smart meters more affordably, i.e. with lower general costs. Finally, the transformative effect of smart meters may be oversold, and we find that smart electricity meters are a technology that is complementary, rather than disruptive or transformative, one that largely does not challenge the dominant practices and roles of electricity suppliers, firms, or network operators.}

Using information society and science and technology statistics for NUTS 2 statistical regions from the Eurostat database, we construct two synthetic indices for cities based on ICT use and capability, and these are used to group the cities into clusters. We then study the relationship between the ICT indices and economic development, taking wealth and intellectual capital as a measurement of knowledge-based European cities.

Electrochromic (EC) technology emerges as a promising solution capable of effectively regulating the transmittance and absorption of light. Notably, dual‐band EC smart windows (DESWs) offer a unique avenue to address this challenge by independently adjusting sunlight and heat entry, anticipated to significantly reduce energy consumption for internal lighting and temperature regulation in buildings. While the potential benefits of DESWs are substantial, research is still in its early stages, facing important obstacles that hinder progress. This review aims to enhance our comprehension of this technology by providing a detailed introduction to the fundamental features of DESWs, encompassing configuration, operating mechanisms, and parameters for performance evaluation. In particular, we explore potential methods and approaches to achieve independent modulation using single-component materials. Additionally, we analyze performance issues and challenges, pinpoint future development directions, and propose corresponding solutions. The purpose of this review is to expedite the research and development of DESWs, offering robust support for the creation of modern energy-efficient buildings and facilitating the transition of the construction industry towards more sustainable and efficient energy utilization.}

However, their capability of differentiating multiple stimuli still remains a challenge. Here, we develop a multimodal smart textile that can simultaneously measure temperature and pulse/touch in real time, with high performance and no signal interference. The smart textile outputs two independent variables, with the whole textile as a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to detect touch/pulse and its core thermoresistive micro/nano porous fiber strand (also is the TENG’s working electrode) to detect temperature. The stretchable core thermoresistive micro/nano porous fiber of the smart textile achieves record-high thermal sensitivity (β = 4994.55 K, α=−5.58%/K at 26 ℃) and the fastest response/recovery time (97/239 ms) among previously reported fiber/textile-based temperature sensors, to our best knowledge. This fiber based on the growth of Fe2(MoO4)3 on graphene has much higher temperature sensing performance (∼3.2 times higher thermal sensitivity) than that based on directly blending Fe2(MoO4)3 and graphene. Moreover, the fiber has high thermal stability and its temperature sensing performance is insensitive to strain (stretching, bending and pressing). The smart textile is demonstrated for artificial sensation and health monitoring to simultaneously provide accurate profiles of both temperature and touch/pulse. This work provides new insights for wearable sensors.}

Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology into poultry farming can revolutionize the way to monitor and manage poultry health. Feeding, preening, and dustbathing are poultry's daily routines. In response to the problem of detecting correct poultry behaviour and health status, this paper proposes a smart poultry monitoring system that leverages IoT sensors to detect and monitor chicken behaviour in poultry farms and provides valuable information to industry stakeholders for management decisions and individual poultry health status. The phases of the proposed system are data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and detection of poultry behaviour via different classification algorithms. An optimized synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) via an artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is applied to solve the data imbalance problem. The experimental results show that an optimized SMOTE obtains better accuracy with 97 % than other algorithms. Further, to attain accuracy in predicting poultry behaviours, Random Forest (RF) achieves superiority compared to other machine learning algorithms with an accuracy of 98 %.}

In this paper, a various-goal energy management system is proposed to arrive at a compromise solution for smoothing the smart home power profile, reducing the electricity bill (E.B) and obtaining a free charging of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) from home and renewable energy sources (RES). This control has been structured into two hierarchical layers. The first aims to maintain an appropriate balance of the Photovoltaic Generator (PVG) power that is scattered into three essential paths: home, vehicles and grid. The second destinates to coordinate the PEVs charging/discharging modes from and to the smart home. Both optimization layers of the proposed framework are executed using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Four scenarios are presented in different seasons with different demand profiles, different electricity prices and illuminations in north Africa, and different PEVs connections states. The simulation results have demonstrated the obtention of smooth home power profiles. As well, the inhabitant can achieve a total daily bill reduction of 26% in autumn, 15.57% in winter, 31.68% in summer and 25% in spring including almost a free charging of PEVs which prove the efficiency of the proposed strategy.}

In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multi-stakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms, such as Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu.}

The importance of natural gas, together with the ongoing liberalization of the gas market, has made the natural gas sector significantly commercially sensitive. To reduce the risk of financial losses, balance group managers often need to have an accurate forecast of natural gas consumption. An accurate forecast will ensure small deviations between actual gas consumption and reserved gas volumes and transmission system capacity resulting in less balancing energy required, which is sold at a higher price in the final balancing process. This paper researches the optimal number of smart meters and best fitted consumption data distribution in order to achieve satisfactory results in terms of the accuracy by using simple forecasting methods. Beside mentioned, this paper provides accuracy overview of various already available forecasting methods, as well as the selection of input parameters for forecasting short term natural gas consumption. Using the calculated linear temperature dependence together with the lognormal distribution, the consumption of natural gas was simulated for 12 different cases. The simulation showed that, if more than 10 000 smart meters were installed, deviation between average estimated natural gas consumption and the real data would be less than ±2.96 %. In case of 100 000 smart meters installed, deviation would be less than ±1.20 %, but the “large” partly temperature independent consumers must be disregarded.}

abstract = {The rapid increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption leads to significant challenges for charging station operators due to the unbalance between the growing demand for charging services and their limited power capacity connected to the grid. To tackle the challenge, this paper applies a two-step architecture in which an energy management system (EMS) in the first step determines the available capacity to charge the present fleet of EVs, after which in the second step this capacity is distributed over the individual EVs. To optimally allocate available power and satisfy user requirements, a user priority-based charging management strategy is proposed. Such priority can optimally order the set of EVs to be charged based on user input. However, relying solely on user-estimated input can be prone to incorrect priority due to inaccurate estimations. Therefore, we introduced a clustering of charging sessions based on the user-provided estimated information in the proposed priority function. These clusters relax the effect of inaccurately estimated user input by grouping charging sessions with similar behavior. Our proposed priority can increase user satisfaction by up to 30%, as measured by the percentage of requested energy that is delivered to users, compared to scenarios without priority, 10% more than priority based solely on estimation information, and 8% more than first-come-first-serve. To avoid exposing the personal behavior of the user, we introduce a decentralized approach, applying a consensus-based method that allows local control per EV charging station and only requires minimal communication of a consensus variable with neighboring charging stations. By introducing the priority in the communication weight matrix of the consensus-based algorithm, we accelerate the convergence rate more than 10 times. Simulation results based on real-world data sets in Belgium demonstrate the proposed method scales well with growing fleet sizes.}

Meanwhile, it has positive nonlinear effects on high-quality green development, but the marginal effects are clearly diminishing. Further study shows city-specific heterogeneity effects, and digital dividends in eastern cities, key urban agglomerations, and high-level cities are more fully released. Moreover, the digital economy can affect high-quality green development in neighboring areas through spatial spillover effects.

abstract = {Smart Tourism for the Industry 4.0 and post Covid-19 challenge needs explainable AI Algorithms adapted for the Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) World with smart (physical components, algorithms, and IoT/mobile connectivity) elements. This paper shows how boosted generalized additives models (GAM) and random forest can be used in conjunction to improve the prediction and model explainability at the same time. This is achieved by using the predictions of the random forest as an outcome of the boosted GAM. Boosted GAMs can not only improve the explainability of random forest, but the random forest can also improve the predictability of boosted GAMs for modeling zoo visitors. This approach also has desirable regularization properties, such as model sparsity of the boosted GAMs. In addition, the current state of the art is provided and a detailed description with descriptive analysis of a case study for zoo visitors. The procedure with integrated XAI techniques, like variable importance measures and partial effects, is explained. In the future, the proposed concept can be implemented also for other industries or as a general method of XAI}

abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) smart charging can effectively enhance the local power demand-supply balance and help improve the renewable power local utilization. Researchers have developed two categories of EV charging: (i) building/grid-to-vehicle, in which the EV can only be charged; and (ii) building/grid-to-vehicle-to-building/grid, in which the vehicles can be both charged and discharged. Until now, the impacts of intelligent charging of EV (such as form of charging and charging limits) on its battery degradation are rarely studied. In response to the dynamic power profiles of the building community, EVs can have complex charging/discharging profiles, which in turn affect its cycling degradation. With the concern of large battery degradation, being unaware of such effects could reduce the EV owners' willingness to join in the smart charging demand response. This study will fill in this knowledge gap by comprehensively investigate how different ways of EV smart charging and EV usage affects its battery degradation and demand response performances in the built environment. Parametric studies considering 65 scenarios combining various EV charging forms, EV charging limits and commuting distances is conducted using a case building community in Sweden. A particle swarm optimization based EV smart charging control is developed to optimize its charging process to minimize the buildings' grid interactions. The Rainflow Counting algorithm is used for evaluating the cycling degradation of EV battery in different charging scenarios. The comparison results recommend implementing smart EV charging with small charging limits, as it can significantly reduce peak energy exchanges (e.g., 9.3 %–13 %) but will not increase the battery degradation dramatically. The study results can support decision makers in selecting suitable EV charging and usage strategies.}

Electrical output performance of a CS-based TENG is enhanced by addition of conductive Super P® carbon black (SP). A 0.04 wt% addition of SP to CS materials is found to increase the dielectric constant and contributes to the intensified triboelectric charge density and hence the electrical output of the CS TENG. The CS-SP TENG exhibits a significant improvement in power output that is over ten times greater than unmodified CS TENG. Furthermore, incorporation of SP also enhances crystallization which reduces the formation of air voids. This leads to a changed surface morphology and improved compressive strength of the CS composite. A smart floor application of the CS-SP TENG to convert mechanical energy from human steps into electricity and motion sensor are also demonstrated.}

This study proposes a new methodology capable of optimizing the waste management process through an enabling technology: the blockchain. An innovative method that can increase monitoring while reducing the general costs of waste management is proposed. A blockchain system is developed for the control of urban waste. In addition, a reward mechanism is established for the citizens in terms of the levels of sorted waste produced and the working procedures of the agency that manages waste collection are optimized. A mathematical model that formalizes the problem for an optimal solution to minimize the costs of all the stakeholders involved in the Waste Management process is also developed. The characteristics that the proposed system allows are very important for the entire process of solid waste management. In fact, the adoption of the blockchain enables full traceability of the waste, ascertainability of each action, and the possibility that every customer can directly verify the information that is stored in the blockchain, such as the quantity of disposed waste, the amount of his reward and several additional data. Last but not least, the integrity of all stored records is fundamental in order to enforce the trust between the citizen and the Municipality that is in charge of dealing with solid waste management.}

A wide range of definitions have been introduced in the literature to characterize smart buildings yet, at present, its’ concept and features are not clearly and uniquely defined. Simultaneously, building energy retrofit concept has been introduced to facilitate achieving the nearly Zero-Energy Building target and reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Up to 90 % of the existing European building stock will still be standing and in use in 2050. Thus, there is a need to upgrade the existing retrofitting strategies into Smart Retrofitting, to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building target and be able to respond to external dynamic conditions such as the weather and the grid. The aim of this research is first to review the concept of smartness in the built environment, highlighting the main features, functions, and technologies of smart buildings, also discussing the possible challenges for smart retrofit applications. The second part of the paper reviews the existing Key Performance Indicators that measure the performance and success in achieving goals in smart buildings. The need to develop a quantified guideline to improve energy and technological innovation is the basis for the increase of the smartness in buildings. Consequently, a set of nine groups of representative performance indicators for smart buildings is developed. This work shows current gaps in the literature and highlights the space for foreseeable future research.}

abstract = {It is known that load forecasting plays an important role for the smart grids and mostly, the users have the combinational load forecast demands with different time-scales. However, due to various internal or external factors, such as poor management, the available load data set is limited. Therefore, the problem becomes as the high-precision combinational load forecast at different time-scales but with limited valid datasets. In this paper, taking the work in a city power company of China as an example, an empirical study for this problem is considered and then a robust forecasting system is built. The forecasting models are designed and screened and then constructed a model library for the system. In order to improve the robustness of the designed system, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) based dynamic model selection method is proposed and finally the performance of the system is verified on the State Grid Chongqing Company of China. The results indicate that our designed multi-temporal-spatial-scales load forecast system can dynamically select the best model for different demands, which demonstrates that the build system is an effective and reliable system-level solution. In particular, for the annual based load forecast, 80% of the industries in the considered city have a MAPE less than 5%, while the MAPE of the whole city is less than 2.160%; for the monthly based load forecast, 87% of the industries in the considered city have a MAPE less than 10%, while the MAPE for the whole city is less than 3.755%. In addition, for the annual based forecast, GM(1,1) is mostly used for the industry-based forecasts, but the model with the highest average forecast accuracy is LR-ER. While for region-based forecasts, the mostly selected models are GM(1,n) and AR. For the monthly based forecast, GM(1,1)-SI and FOA-HW have a higher average accuracy than other models for both industries- and region-based forecasts, respectively.}

The conventional drugs with traditional administrations have several drawbacks; they exhibit limited solubility, nonspecific targeting, reduced therapeutic effect, and cause drug resistance and severe side effects. Therefore tremendous efforts were done to design and develop novel drug delivery carriers and exploit the nanotechnology advantages to overcome these hurdles. Scientists were able to synthesize nanostructured carriers to enhance the efficacy, bioavailability, biocompatibility, solubility, and stability of the conventional drugs. In addition, these carriers were upgraded to become multifunctional stimuli-responsive nanosystems with specific mechanisms of action. Beside the benefits of using nanocarriers, these smart nanosystems enabled selective targeting and sustained drug release with high controllability over the dose. The physiological environment exhibits different stimuli to be exploited in designing such nanosystems like pH, glucose concentration, and enzymatic activity. On the other hand, stimuli can also be external like light, ultrasound, magnetic field, and heat. So, the aim of this chapter is to present different stimuli exploited in the fabrication of smart drug delivery nanosystems. Moreover, different materials, such as polymers, metallic, carbon-based, and lipids, used to construct these nanosystems will be discussed. It also addresses the mechanism of action of these materials responding to various stimuli as well as the multistimuli-responsive nanosystems. Eventually, it highlights the limitations and challenges of using and optimizing such nanosystems and future prospects to test them in clinical trials.}

In this context, a systematic workflow is presented to extract useful information from various data sources to support housing energy simulations and municipal retrofit program planning. Permit data analysis supported refinement of housing data in Kelowna's urban digital twin. Results from building permit data analysis serve to update housing attributes including construction year and dwelling type. Results from heating permit analysis suggest that 17.5% of Kelowna dwellings could be potential candidates for heating system upgrades. Regarding thermostat setpoint temperature and occupancy for energy simulations, results obtained from smart thermostat data analysis were compared with EnerGuide Rating System (ERS) assumptions to investigate the potential improvements that can be made in energy simulation inputs. Comparative results indicated variations of up to 2 °C between smart thermostat data and EnerGuide assumptions for thermostat setpoint temperatures. Also, smart thermostat data suggests that 87% of dwellings were occupied for more than 50% of the time, whereas in ERS, occupancy is assumed to be 50%. Together, the overall data workflow and the detailed investigation of different datasets contributes to the development of a best practice methodology for housing energy modeling and mapping for municipalities in support of GHG emission reductions. Further, recommendations for permit data collection and scope for future research works are provided.}

The latest approach in coatings is to manipulate the material and structural composition of the deposition at submicron scales to develop functional architecture. This sequential fabrication of submicron layers featuring unique material compositions and topography result in unique and exotic properties suitable for the development of smart coatings. Several such smart coating architectures have been conceived and investigated by researchers that are summarized in this study. Notable examples of such coatings include sensing, self-healing, self-lubricating, self-cleaning, and bioactive systems. Surface architectures with enhanced and novel functionalities such as self-stratifying, super-insulating and thermochromic are also emerging and are likely to become part of the smart coating portfolio. This article starts by briefly introducing the primary concepts associated with smart tribological coatings along with their functionalities. The different types of coating structures and their smart characteristics are discussed in subsequent sections. Altogether, the article brings together the various concepts in smart tribological coatings that offer significant potential for a range of functional applications.}

Energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind can be stored in battery storage systems (BESS) and released when consumers need it most. Electric traction motors are built inside one or more of the carriages of an EMU, eliminating the need for a separate engine. Electric trains can go further and quicker than those propelled by steam engines. There are several advantages to using electric trains, such as efficiently converting fuel into kinetic energy. Rail travel is affected by fluctuations in electrical power. With AI, energy waste and prices might be reduced, and the deployment of clean, renewable energy sources could be facilitated and accelerated in power systems globally. Artificial intelligence (AI) can benefit from the design, operation, and management of power systems. Voltage fluctuations occur if a large number of electricity gadgets are utilized simultaneously. Voltage fluctuations, especially in extreme circumstances, can be extremely hazardous to the safety and other possessions. The researchers devised the EMU-AI-BESS approach to address these problems. Trains powered by lithium-ion batteries can go on both kinds of track. Battery-electric technology has been used to expand electrified metro lines in several cities throughout the globe, and many more are contemplating it. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen can be effectively managed and distributed due to smart grid technologies. The smart grid links a wide range of distributed energy resources to the power grid.AI can assist in minimizing traffic congestion, detecting dangers, managing transportation, analyzing travel demand, and potentially cutting greenhouse gas emissions. AI is being utilized in today’s rail applications to increase asset management and train schedules, train speed control, and other factors. AI’s primary goal is to give computers to execute mental functions, including decision-making, problem-solving, perception, and communication comprehension. Artificial intelligence will be needed to manage decentralized grids as the world transitions to renewable energy. Using AI, power supply and demand can be balanced in real-time, optimizing energy consumption and storage to minimize rates.}

However, the actual environmental costs of integrating IoT-based sensing systems into smart buildings have rarely been considered when reporting on their overall sustainability footprint. This paper presents an Emergy-based methodological approach to ascertain the effectiveness of integrating IoT-based sensing systems into smart buildings. The proposed method employs three novel Emergy Neutrality Indices (ENIs): The Sensing System to Building Emergy (SBEm) ratio, the Emergy Neutrality Score (EmN), and the Emergy Payback Time (EmPBT). The Solar House at Gainesville, Florida, retrofitted with an IoT-based sensing system, is used as an example building for computing these indices. A Building Energy Model (BEM) is created using the EnergyPlusTM simulation engine available in DesignBuilder V7 to determine the operational Emergy of the building. A custom-built CO2 sensor is used to collect the real-time occupancy data for incorporation into the BEM. The Emergy Neutrality computation demonstrates that the integration of the given sensing system is effective in the Solar House, with SBEm, EmN, and EmPBT values of 2.06E-03, 0.28, and 3.61 years, respectively. By varying the sensors’ energy-savings potential and spatio-functional configurations, nine design scenarios are generated and evaluated for their environmental performance using Emergy ratios and the proposed ENIs. Finally, the Solar House is compared with the Rinker Hall to emphasise the significance of reporting these indices. In the future, designers, architects, and other stakeholders could use these ENIs as useful sustainability assessment tools to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of integrating these smart sensing systems into buildings.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the WO3-x/PVA composite films as smart photochromic coatings on glass substrate by two methods: solvent casting (SC) and dip-coating (DC). The two methods were thoroughly compared using experimental and theoretical means. All prepared films have been optically investigated by ex-situ and in-situ UV–Vis spectrometry, leading to insight on their coloring/bleaching amplitudes and kinetics. It was found that the SC films exhibited the best photochromic amplitude with a visible and infrared optical contrast ΔCvis=34.37 and ΔCIR=7.9, whereas ΔCvis and ΔCIR reached less than 20.2 and 5.4 for the best films issued from the DC process. Further, a two-flux model (KubelkaMunk) was adapted to understand the associated impacts of absorption and scattering in our composite films. The calculations revealed that the simulated scattering factor was higher in the case of the DC films than for the SC films, explaining hence the higher photochromic amplitude of the latter. After carefully analyzing the relationship between the SC and DC films characterizations and optical performance, we concluded that the SC method offered films that are a better candidate for post-optical application in terms of scattering reduction, improved visible/infrared contrast, and better photochromic efficiency. Nevertheless, the “thick” SC films get a slightly lower kinetic response than the “thin” DC films. Finally, the cooling effect of the photochromic SC films was tested by integrating them in a model wooden room under the irradiation of an artificial solar source. The photochromic SC smart windows proposed here are equally efficient while being more affordable than electrochromic panels or VO2 thermochromic thin films to reduce the inner house temperature (almost 20 °C) upon solar irradiation, demonstrating their great potential as smart cost-effective energy-saving materials}

However, wireless communication networks are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and easier to be eavesdropped, so researchers have proposed a number of secure protocols. In addition to being vulnerable to cyber-attacks, AMI also exposes consumer power data which poses privacy issues. While there has been a lot of research to address these issues, the validation efforts mostly utilized simulators and actual overhead due to these approaches have not been captured in a realistic setup. Therefore, in this paper, we chose two open-source wireless mesh networking standards, IEEE 802.11s and ZigBee, and built an AMI testbed at FIU Engineering Center that will be able to collect power readings from smart meters. Then, we used the testbed to assess and compare the performance of the two standards under fully homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation-based privacy-preserving protocols that can provide computation on the encrypted data. Extensive experiments under a variety of conditions indicate that IEEE 802.11s-based wireless mesh networks are more suitable for the AMI networks when used with a reliable transport layer protocol at the expense of data collection completion time while ZigBee can be a viable option for protocols that generate relatively far smaller data packets.}

Municipal solid waste is the most crucial factor in contemporary urban development due to polluted environmental scenarios and causing the spread of diseases anomalously despite high transportation and storage costs. A sensor-based e-smart device with components has been developed to store and transport solid waste with sensor-based technology containing filling, picking, dropping, and waste weight. Multi-compartment bins can be used to store and transport the solid waste with GPS module tracking for conversion into energy to the plant. The underground container contains solid waste ranges from 4.5 cum to 8 cum with a weight capacity of 1650 kgs–7200 kgs. E-smart features like filling alarm, route tracking, and volume can be controlled with ultrasonic sensor transponder system (EPC Class-I, Generic-2) more efficiently than conventional systems at low cost. This system will fill the gap with more solid waste volume within closed containers without any atmospheric influence, civilian health, smell, odor, and other harmful gases produced by solid waste. E-smart underground solid waste bins can help significantly minimize open dumping of municipal solid waste and save operation, fuel, transportation cost, and traveling time up to 40%.}

In this work, we provide a flexible architecture based on building blocks suited for detecting anomalies in the network traffic and the application-layer data exchanged by IoT devices in the context of Smart Home. Following this architecture, we have defined a particular Intrusion Detector System (IDS) for a case study that uses a public dataset with the electrical consumption of 21 home devices over one year. In particular, we have defined ten Indicators of Compromise (IoC) to detect network attacks and two anomaly detectors to detect false command or data injection attacks. We have also included a signature-based IDS (Snort) to extend the detection range to known attacks. We have reproduced eight network attacks (e.g., DoS, scanning) and four False Command or Data Injection attacks to test our IDS performance. The results show that all attacks were successfully detected by our IoCs and anomaly detectors with a false positive rate lower than 0.3%. Signature detection was able to detect only 4 out of 12 attacks. Our architecture and the IDS developed can be a reference for developing future IDS suited to different contexts or use cases. Given that we use a public dataset, our contribution can also serve as a baseline for comparison with new techniques that improve detection performance.}

We investigate the effects of a 40% EV adoption on three parts of the low voltage distribution network (LVDN) of Frederiksberg, a densely urbanised municipality in Denmark. Our findings indicate that especially cable and transformer overloading poses a challenge. However, the impact of EVs varies significantly between each LVDN area and charging scenario. Across scenarios and LVDNs, the share of cables facing congestion ranges between 5% and 60%. It is also revealed, that time-of-use (ToU)-based and single-day cost-minimised charging could be beneficial for LVDNs with moderate EV adoption rates. In contrast, multiple-day optimisation will likely lead to severe congestion, as such strategies concentrate demand on a single day that would otherwise be distributed over several days, thus raising concerns on how to prevent it. The wider implications of our study are that, while initial concerns have mainly been focused on congestion caused by uncontrolled charging during peak hours, a shift towards cost-based smart charging driven by a growing awareness of time-dependent electricity prices, could result in a sharp increase in charging synchronisation with undesirable implications for the PDN.}

In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to forecast future energy consumption considering not only past consumption data, but also context data such as inhabitants’ actions and activities, use of household appliances, interaction with furniture and doors, and environmental data. We performed an experimental evaluation with real-world data acquired in an instrumented environment from a large set of users.

A pilot study found that consumers believe that smart and connected products from the same brand perform better than those from different brands in terms of compatibility. Study 1 showed that consumers tend to purchase multiple devices from the same brand (vs. different brands) and thus display higher brand concentration when purchasing smart and connected products compared with traditional products. Further studies confirmed that such brand choice concentration in purchasing smart and connected products can be attenuated among consumers who are familiar with this product category (Study 2) or who are convinced that a connecting hub can smooth compatibility issues across different appliances (Study 3).}

While IIoT brings us much convenience, a series of security and scalability issues related to permission operations rise to the surface during device communications. Hence, at present, a reliable and dynamic access control management system for IIoT is in urgent need. Up till now, numerous access control architectures have been proposed for IIoT. However, owing to centralized models and heterogeneous devices, security and scalability requirements still cannot be met. In this paper, we offer a smart contract token-based solution for decentralized access control in IIoT systems. Specifically, there are three smart contracts in our system, including the Token Issue Contract (TIC), User Register Contract (URC), and Manage Contract (MC). These three contracts collaboratively supervise and manage various events in IIoT environments. We also utilize the lightweight and post-quantum encryption algorithm-Nth-degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) to preserve user privacy during the registration process. Subsequently, to evaluate our proposed architecture's performance, we build a prototype platform that connects to the local blockchain. Finally, experiment results show that our scheme has achieved secure and dynamic access control for the IIoT system compared with related research.}

We conducted a mixed-methods study (questionnaires and interviews) with primary-school children aged 6–11 in Scotland to establish children's understanding of how voice-based CAs work, how they perceive their cognitive abilities, agency and other human-like qualities, their awareness and trust of privacy aspects when using CAs and what they perceive as appropriate verbal interactions with CAs. Most children overestimated the CAs' intelligence and were uncertain about the systems' feelings or agency. They also lacked accurate understanding of data privacy and security aspects, and believed it was wrong to be rude to conversational assistants. Exploring children's current understanding of AI-supported technology has educational implications; such findings will enable educators to develop appropriate materials to address the pressing need for AI literacy.}

However, source inference attacks (SIAs) can infer the connection between physiological data in training datasets with FL clients and reveal the identities of participants to the attackers. We propose a comprehensive smart healthcare framework for sharing physiological data, named FRESH, that is based on FL and ring signature defense from the attacks. In FRESH, physiological data are collected from individuals by wearable devices. These data are processed by edge computing devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablet PCs) that train ML models using local data. The model parameters are uploaded by edge computing devices to the central server for joint training of FL models of disease prediction. In this procedure, certificateless ring signature is used to hide the source of parameter updates during joint training for FL to effectively resist SIAs. In the proposed ring signature schema, an improved batch verification algorithm is designed to leverage additivity of linear operations on elliptic curves and to help reduce the computing workload of the server. Experimental results demonstrate that FRESH effectively reduces the success rate of SIAs and the batch verification method significantly improves the efficiency of signature verification. FRESH can be applied to large scale smart healthcare systems with FL involving large numbers of users.}

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMSs) have recently been studied and proposed explicitly for HEM. In this paper, we propose a novel nature-inspired hybrid Genetic Flower Pollination Algorithm (GFPA) to minimize cost with an affordable delay in appliance scheduling. Our proposed GFPA algorithm combines elements of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to create a hybrid approach. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we consider a scalable town consisting of 1, 10, 30, and 50 homes, respectively. The proposed solution finds an optimal scheduling pattern that simultaneously minimizes EC and Peak to Average Ratio (PAR) while maximizing User Comfort (UC). We assume that all homes are homogeneous in terms of appliances and power consumption patterns. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme GFPA performs better when applying Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) signal using different Operational Time Intervals (OTIs) and compared with unscheduled, GA, and FPA-based solutions in terms of reducing cost since they achieve on average 98%, 36%, 23%, and 22%, respectively. Similarly, PAR averages 98%, 36%, 59%, and 55%, respectively. While, UC comparing to GA and FPA, are around 88%, 48%, and 63%, respectively. Our proposed scheme achieves better results by applying Real Time Pricing (RTP) signals and different OTIs. As these schemes, i.e., unscheduled, GA, FPA, and GFPA, achieve cost on average 92%, 50%, 29%, and 28%, respectively. While PAR on average 94%, 39%, 62%, and 56%, and UC for GA, FPA, and GFPA on average 98%, 52%, and 49%, respectively. Overall, our proposed GFPA algorithm offers a more effective solution for minimizing EC with an affordable delay in appliance scheduling while considering PAR and UC.}

The growth of win-win energy sharing between MGs attracts attention to smart information center (SIC) concept in MGs’ community, which facilitates sustainable solutions across three key objectives: lower carbon emission, sufficient utilization, and long-term cooperation. This paper designs a two-stage decision framework for day-ahead operations of SIC, where the first stage minimizes the total cost (i.e. operational cost and carbon emission cost) by the proposed multi-energy intra-scheduling and inter-sharing model (MIIM) and the second stage implements the smart cost-saving redistribution model (SCRM) to stimulate MGs in long-term joining of energy sharing. The extended alternating direction multipliers method algorithm (E-ADMM) is developed to protect the privacy of MGs' data while approximating the optimal solution of MIIM. The case study proves that a) demand response and energy sharing in MIIM result in cost savings of 2.01% for carbon emissions and 7.25% for total operations; b) renewable energy has been fully utilized and the total multi-energy loss has been avoided nearly 92.22% in MIIM; c) the asymmetric Nash bargaining approach fits the SCRM with incentive cooperation, whereby those who contribute more gain a higher share; d) the optimal gap of E-ADMM is less than 0.2% by iterated insensitive decision result from each MG, which computes in polynomial time when the scale of MG increases; e) the two-stage framework performs better with more heterogeneity of MGs. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights for guidance and models with worldwide generalization potential.}

This paper proposes a bi-stage multi-objectives optimization of the smart multi energy system with optimal coordination of active consumers than electrical and thermal prices in the day-ahead market. The optimization is implemented under uncertainty of demand and price for electrical and thermal energies. In the first stage, original electrical and thermal demand curves are optimized using demand shifting strategy based on energy prices. Then, optimized electrical and thermal demand curves are applied in the second stage for solve a multi-objective functions such as minimization of the emission polluting, operation costs and maximizing the smart multi energy systems flexibility. Moreover, reliability indices and participation of the battery energy storage system as local generation are analyzed to improve the resiliency of the smart multi energy systems by some active consumers. Using the augmented epsilon-constraint method Pareto frontier solutions of multi-objective in the second stage are extracted and the best solution is determined in the decision-making approach by TOPSIS procedure. To demonstrate superiority and validation of the proposed optimization, three cases studies are examined to improve economic, environmental and resilience indices.}

However, it is difficult to find instances in which the results of data analysis have been applied to actual policy in the field of crime prevention. The South Korean police force recognizes the need for smart policing and is engaged in various research and field support activities. Some examples that are especially relevant for crime investigation include analyzing the connections between cases and predicting the location of the next crime in a series of crimes and the location of suspects. However, it is difficult to find examples of police policy that use big data. Therefore, this study aims to suggest a model that uses big data to respond to emergency calls efficiently. First, we extract hotspots that are predicted to be locations of criminal activity based on an analysis of the association between community environment data and crime data. Second, we create a route having the shortest travel time to the crime location by developing a route optimization algorithm. Lastly, we assess the performance of the patrol routes in reflecting real-time traffic information. If the data application model suggested in this study could be adjusted and applied to the current police patrol system, the model could be used by each police department effectively.}

We argue that modern cities have to develop knowledge‐ based strategies for smart, safe and sound (3‐S) city development, supported by urban performance assessment (UPA) as a framework for sustainable urban planning. The present study builds on these strategic notions and articulates the message that smart urban policy should look into input resources in relation to output performance. Particular attention will be paid to the constituents and the role of multiple safety indicators in urban performance analysis. Next, an appropriate method from the industrial management literature, namely, super‐efficient data en591elopment analysis (SE‐DEA) will be utilized in order to undertake a comparative performance assessment of safety conditions in 57 world cities, followed by a similar analysis for 14 large European cities.

Resumen
El desarrollo urbano sostenible exige un conjunto equilibrado de condiciones que puedan crear una alta calidad de vida (incluida la seguridad y la protección) en las ciudades. Se sostiene que las ciudades modernas tienen que desarrollar estrategias basadas en el conocimiento para un desarrollo de las ciudades que sea 3‐S (sabio, seguro y sensato), apoyado por el uso de la evaluación del rendimiento urbano como un marco conceptual para la planificación urbana sostenible. El presente estudio se basa en estas nociones estratégicas y articula el mensaje de que una política urbana inteligente debe examinar los recursos de los insumos en relación con el rendimiento de los productos. Se prestó especial atención a los componentes y al papel de los múltiples indicadores de seguridad en el análisis del desempeño urbano. A continuación, se empleó un método apropiado obtenido de la literatura sobre gestión industrial, a saber, el análisis envolvente de datos supereficiente para realizar una evaluación comparativa de las condiciones de seguridad en 57 ciudades del mundo, seguido de un análisis similar para 14 grandes ciudades europeas. Tanto en todo el mundo como en toda Europa, parece haber diferencias significativas en el desempeño de las ciudades en materia de seguridad, lo que significa que hay un amplio margen en muchas ciudades para la introducción de políticas de seguridad estratégica y eficaz.

As a consequence, universities should include a wider mix of disciplines in the curricula of their courses. Hence, to overcome existing criticisms and to provide some suggestions on how to enhance universities׳ performances, we thought of education as a process with inputs, outputs, and relevant dependencies. We called such a university a “smarter university” in which knowledge is a common heritage of teachers and students. In our research the smarter university model is based on a smart-city-like model, due to the fact that next generation networks and relevant services are going to be more and more integrated with existing infrastructure and information management systems. Thus, it is mandatory that smart solutions are the most prominent assets of modern university environments to improve the effectiveness of higher education. In this paper, we report the experimental results from a specific case study of collaboration between industry and university, which could be used as a reference for the definition of patterns to be applied in the redesign of the current education systems, even though the experiment refers to a technological application scenario.}

abstract = {The threat of climate change motivates the expansion of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) as well as the transition to plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). Both technologies present unique challenges to electricity systems, potentially leading to high grid expansion cost. In this paper, we present a detailed assessment on how smart-charging of PEVs can mitigate these problems and reduce cost on the distribution grid level. To this end, we propose a heuristic policy that dynamically decides on charging of PEVs, curtailment of VRES, and subsequently on infrastructure investments trading off fixed investments with variable operational costs. The main inputs are modeled as stochastic and the proposed policy is non-anticipative. We conduct a comprehensive case study for Germany in the year 2035 using detailed descriptions of existing distribution grids, realistic driving patterns, and real-world VRES feed-in data. Potential savings of €6.2 billion in investment costs lead to a reduction in total distribution grid cost of around 19%. This result is achieved by upgrading 7 million (21%) PEV chargers all over Germany. Upgrading 100% of chargers to smart-chargers as is proposed in the extant literature is clearly sub-optimal as it leads to significantly higher total cost. A closer investigation for single grids reveals that savings as well as the optimal share of smart chargers varies widely between grids. In particular, the potential of smart charging is much greater in rural areas than in urban centers. Furthermore, the results suggest that curtailment of VRES production is economically only in rare circumstances.}

This inevitably results in an incomplete experience for the visually impaired as tactile exploration is the dominant substitute of sight. In this paper, we focus on Information and Communication Technologies utilisation to enable cultural heritage content to become more accessible to visually impaired both physically as well as intellectually and thus help foster social inclusion. We have developed three prototype systems that are based on the smart exhibit concept. This involves features that are common in Internet of Things devices such as single board computers, microcontrollers, RFIDs and proximity sensors. We combine these features in a cost-effective manner to produce haptic accessible replicas through 3D digitisation and printing that are further enriched with on-demand modular narrations. More specifically, we present aptos.Exhibit: a multi-user smart exhibition system, aptos.Map: a stand-alone interactive tactile map and aptos.myExhibit: a 3D printed miniatures and narration-based system to enable cultural reserve exploration at users’ own space and time. We describe in detail the functionality of each prototype and discuss on their implementation properties. The cultural content presented through the three prototypes derived from previous 3D digitisation projects of religious monuments located in Northern Greece. Evaluation sessions were organised with 25 visually impaired users who experienced all three systems and provided feedback. The participants opinions and suggestions were collected by using questionnaires and interviews. We present in detail the reported feedback related to the prototypes general assessment, usability, robustness and the overall offered experience of accessing the encapsulated cultural and historical content. We drive our conclusions from their responses in relation to content, interaction and experience. We further discuss on our findings related to enabling visually impaired to interactively access cultural content by fusing technologies such as Internet of Things, 3D digitisation, printing and on-demand narration.}

abstract = {—As a result of the increasing demand for different energies with technological development, and with the rapid development of energy hubs (EHs), issues such as computation speed, big data and information privacy, robustness, etc. are becoming increasingly vital. Also, the problem of communication packet loss leads to an incompatibility between the generated and consumed energy. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes an Internet of things-Fog-Cloud distributed consensus-based energy management algorithm to optimally solve the energy mismatch problem in an EH environment considering communication information loss and uncertainties of some EH elements. A MATLAB/Simulink-based model of a hypothetical EH system is modified to support real-time communication. Two case studies are applied to explain the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different packet loss scenarios. The system's sensitivity was studied depending on the number of iterations and the uncertainties of the renewable energy sources, energy prices, and load demands. Also, a comparison was made between the results obtained by the proposed method and the optimization results using the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization techniques. The results prove the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method for the demand management system in EHs. The results show that the proposed algorithm decreases the daily system operating cost from 372.421 to 369.941 $ and the total CO2 emissions cost from 4848.5 to 4103.1 $. In addition, the daily energy mismatch between the generated and consumed values decreases from 579.85 to 0 kWh in the electrical system and from 435.14 to 0.073 kWhth in the heating system. Based on the previous results, the proposed algorithm of EHs contributes significantly to the development of sustainable cities.}

abstract = {The development of transportation networks has constantly increased the cross-boundary flow of people, logistics, and capital. However, when the cross-boundary flows span two regions with different political systems, cross-boundary mobility studies become difficult to perform due to the unavailability of reliable and direct research data. Consequently, in-depth and fine-scale cross-boundary mobility studies remain lacking. With the aid of a smart card dataset, this paper proposes a new framework to break the deadlock in cross-boundary travel behavior studies. Drawing on a 35-day Shenzhen smart card dataset, our study aims to unravel the Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers' mobility patterns in Shenzhen on the basis of the assumption that some Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers who travel through checkpoints to Shenzhen hold a Shenzhen metro smart card to use the Shenzhen metro system easily and rapidly. Through this assumption, we develop a method for identifying travel by Hong Kongers visiting Shenzhen. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to use emerging big data to explore a fine-scale cross-boundary travel behavior between Hong Kong and mainland China. The research results can be summarized in two aspects. (1) Temporal features: Hong Kongers mostly prefer weekends and afternoon periods (11 a.m.-6 p.m.) to travel to Shenzhen, but they have a considerably low cross-boundary travel frequency (54.5% travel only once in 35 days). When they are traveling in Shenzhen, they usually take only two metro trips, spending approximately 15 min in the subway; their duration in Shenzhen is approximately 4.5 h on weekends, and is slightly longer on holidays (5.02 h) and shorter on workdays (4.09 h). (2) Spatial features: some Hong Kongers tend to take Shenzhen as the transfer stop for going to other cities. The travel spatial scope of Hong Kong cross-boundary travelers is almost confined to the center area of Shenzhen. They prefer to travel to nearby and mature business districts well equipped with commercial service facilities, such as Laojie, Guomao, Shopping Park, and Grand Theater.}

This ‘smartification of cycling’ is a phenomenon that is increasingly attracting attention and a variety of interests, fuelled both by the processes of transitioning to smart mobility and a boom of attention to cycling in cities worldwide. However, proposed cycling futures, both implicit and explicit, receive little critical scrutiny. Here, we fill this gap by mapping smart cycling innovations and their key features. We examine how innovations are believed to change the way cycling is practiced, made sense of and governed. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we analyse 86 website texts of smart cycling innovations and systematically outline changes envisioned by innovators. Having identified tensions between and within a range of promised futures, we conclude that smart cycling futures are multiple and contested, just as cycling presents are. Therefore, we propose a number of questions for further research to advance a more nuanced understanding of the range of futures of smart cycling in academic thinking and potentially to support decision-making at different levels of governance. Understanding diverse, contested, embodied and embedded cycling presents is part and parcel of imagining and co-creating (smart) cycling futures.}

This research pioneers an intelligent model by enhancing the dendritic neural regression (DNR) framework, employing the Seagull Optimization Algorithm with Marine Predator Algorithm (SOAMPA) for optimal predictions. Leveraging recent advancements in metaheuristic optimization techniques, the study reveals the superior performance of the novel SOAMPA approach in predictive accuracy, marking a significant breakthrough in predicting CO2-N2 mixture viscosities with implications for advancing CCUS projects and diverse industries. The optimized DNR model, empowered by the modified SOAMPA optimization technique, contributes to estimating the viscosity of N2-CO2 mixture gases. Utilizing inputs like pressure, temperature, mole fraction of N2, and model fraction of CO2, the models are trained and tested on a dataset comprising over 3030 data samples from public literature.

In the United Kingdom, hydrogen is currently being tested as a replacement fuel for natural gas, which could be used to supply low-carbon energy to parts of the country. Transitioning the residential sector towards a net-zero future will call for an inclusive understanding of consumer preferences for emerging technologies. In response, this paper explores consumer attitudes towards domestic cooking and heating technologies, and energy appliances of the future, which could include a role for hydrogen hobs and boilers in UK homes. To access qualitative evidence on this topic, we conducted ten online focus groups (N = 58) with members of the UK public between February and April 2022. The study finds that existing gas users wish to preserve the best features of gas cooking, such as speed, responsiveness and controllability, but also desire the potential safety and aesthetic benefits of electric systems, principally induction hobs. Meanwhile, future heating systems should ensure thermal comfort, ease of use, energy efficiency and smart performance, while providing space savings and noise reduction, alongside demonstrable green benefits. Mixed-methods multigroup analysis suggests divergence between support levels for hydrogen homes, which implies a degree of consumer heterogeneity. Foremost, we find that domestic hydrogen acceptance is positively associated with interest and engagement with renewable energy and fuel poverty pressures. We conclude that internalising the perspectives of consumers is critical to enabling constructive socio-technical imaginaries for low-carbon domestic energy futures.}

Putting real-world assumptions into practice with real-time waste bins' fill levels has not been considered in previous literature and can be investigated by utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) concept. In this paper, two sub-models are developed using the vehicle routing problem concept. The first sub-model uses modern traceability IoT-based devices to obtain data in real-time, making it possible to identify the threshold waste level (TWL) parameter. The importance of the first sub-model is not only to determine an effective and innovative collection route for achieving sustainable being social and environmental impacts on WMS, but also to consider the priority of visiting bins based on their significance. Both waste separation and transferring them into the recovery value center are considered in the second model, both to maximize the recovery value and minimize visual pollution. The recent and capable meta-heuristic algorithms are utilized and probed to test the proposed problem's accuracy and find the best algorithm for this problem. Finally, in the sensitivity analysis section, different parameters of the problem were investigated. Besides, by defining and analyzing two indices, the best efficiency in using the transport fleet, the optimal amount of traveled distance, and the amount of collected waste can be achieved by setting the TWL between 70 and 75%.}

Multifunctional pavement is a new paradigm that enhances pavement functionalities, durability, and serviceability for intelligent transport system. Cement-asphalt composite possesses significant attributes, including self-healing, self-sensing, photocatalytic, and thermochromic capacities, which collectively contribute to the multifunctionalities of these pavements. The self-healing property plays a vital role in extending the service life of pavement and enhancing its durability. At the same time, self-sensing concrete, a concept widely explored for structural health monitoring, finds its applications. The photocatalytic feature aids in reducing pollution stemming from vehicle emissions, while the thermochromic capacity allows for temperature detection in asphalt concrete pavements. Previous research has mainly concentrated on the discrete attributes and performance of these functionalities within cement-asphalt composite. Achieving these multifunctional capabilities involves the incorporation of diverse carbon nanomaterials into cement-asphalt composite, such as carbon black (CB), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene nanoplates (GNPs), and so on. Notably, there is an increasing focus on integrating these functionalities within pavements themselves. Functional concrete has been effectively deployed within smart transport system, encompassing pavements, railways, bridges, and tunnels, for the purposes of infrastructure health monitoring and traffic-flow management. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in multifunctional technologies, highlighting potential applications across novel domains. The insights will serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into multifunctional pavements and their integration into intelligent transport systems.}

For households, energy trading and demand management can reduce electricity costs. However, consumers generally obtain market offers based on their expectations and the forecasts of other households. However, the P2P exchange system is not able to quantify the gap between these offers and the best market. The objective of this paper is to apply deep reinforcement learning techniques to optimal energy trading and demand response (DR) methods within a peer-to-peer (P2P) market. The main objective is to maximize cost reductions. The best approach to achieve this objective was investigated as part of this project. The complexity of domestic energy trading and energy recovery is formally characterized as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Through decentralized training and performance-based learning, the strategy maximizes policy and value functions. In order to identify the most effective proactive solutions, a comparative analysis is carried out between the two parties. Based on the simulation results, it was observed that implementing the recommended reinforcement learning strategy to optimize peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange can lead to a significant improvement in the average household reward. Specifically, the average household reward can be increased by 7.6% and 12.08% by employing the aforementioned approach.}

Many studies suggested various solutions for applying BESS to the grid system, yet the existing literature is dispersed across different scopes, scales, and levels. Previous studies also lack a comprehensive overview of different application strategies of BESS within the urban landscape. Therefore, this study aimed to broaden our perspective and implement the concept of “BESS-based energy sharing” for carbon-neutrality at the urban level. Towards this end, this study investigated the key factors and main technologies for BESS application in the city through a comprehensive literature review. These results indicated that the limitations of current application technologies of the BESS and energy sharing using BESS should be overcome in the carbon-neutral city. As a result, this study proposed future direction of the BESS application strategies towards smart energy sharing in cities, as follows: (i) bi-directional interactions across hierarchical levels of the city; (ii) integrated management for high connectivity of distributed generation; and (iii) development of a BESS-based energy management system. This study would allow scholars, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand the energy sharing mechanism within the city and provide systematic guidelines and pathways towards smart energy sharing with the advanced energy infrastructure using BESS from a bi-directional perspective across different hierarchical levels of the city.}

Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is scarcely any discussion on its design theories, which serves as the fundamental basis. To identify the limitations of current design approaches in supporting Smart PSS development and suggest some future research directions, this paper conducts a systematic literature review at existing engineering design methodologies to verify its appropriateness for the Smart PSS development. 9 typical design methods have been chosen based on the systematic review of 101 representative items published ever since the coin of PSS to date (04/05/2020) and 48 supplementary works. They are further compared and evaluated from three aspects, including “smart design” objects, enabling smart technologies and smart application fields. Not surprisingly, the investigation results indicate that none of the existing methodologies can fully meet the design characteristics of Smart PSS, while three research directions of Smart PSS design methodology are provided as the potential solution at last. It is hoped this paper can attract more open discussions and offer useful insights to both academics and industries in their development of Smart PSS.}

abstract = {To meet widely recognised carbon neutrality targets, over the last decade metropolitan regions around the world have implemented policies to promote the generation and use of sustainable energy. Nevertheless, there is an availability gap in formulating and evaluating these policies in a timely manner, since sustainable energy capacity and generation are dynamically determined by various factors along dimensions based on local economic prosperity and societal green ambitions. We develop a novel data-driven platform to predict and evaluate energy transition policies by applying an artificial neural network and a technology diffusion model. Using Singapore, London, and California as case studies of metropolitan regions at distinctive stages of energy transition, we show that in addition to forecasting renewable energy generation and capacity, the platform is particularly powerful in formulating future policy scenarios. We recommend global application of the proposed methodology to future sustainable energy transition in smart regions.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for smart integrated risk management in arid regions. The framework combines flash flood modelling, statistical methods, artificial intelligence (AI), geographic evaluations, risk analysis, and decision-making modules to enhance community resilience. Flash flood is simulated by using Watershed Modelling System (WMS). Statistical methods are also used to trim outlier data from physical systems and climatic data. Furthermore, three AI methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Nearest Neighbours Classification (NNC), are used to predict and classify flash flood occurrences. Geographic Information System (GIS) is also utilised to assess potential risks in vulnerable regions, together with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methods. The decision-making module employs the Classic Delphi technique to classify the appropriate solutions for flood risk control. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the real case study of the Khosf region in Iran, which suffers from both drought and severe floods simultaneously, exacerbated by recent climate changes. The results show high Coefficient of determination (R2) scores for the three AI methods, with SVM at 0.88, ANN at 0.79, and NNC at 0.89. FMEA results indicate that over 50% of scenarios are at high flood risk, while HAZOP indicates 30% of scenarios with the same risk rate. Additionally, peak flows of over 24 m3/s are considered flood occurrences that can cause financial damage in all scenarios and risk techniques of the case study. Finally, our research findings indicate a practical decision support system that is compatible with sustainable development concepts and can enhance community resilience in arid regions.}

However, little attention has been paid to the PDLC smart window in terms of overall building energy performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of the PDLC window on heating, cooling, and lighting loads and daylight performance, for an office building utilising energy building modelling and daylight analysis tool. The study is limited to two contrasting climate zones; an arid climate (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) and a temperate climate (London, United Kingdom). The results showed that the PDLC window was more effective in Riyadh (arid climate) with a cooling reduction of 12.8% than London (temperate climate) with a heating reduction of 4.9%. PDLC provided excellent interior illuminance in both cities.}

abstract = {In a crowded metro network, it is not unusual to observe that passengers actively choose not to board but wait for the next train for a seat, even if there is vacant standing room on the arriving train. We analyse such behaviour using a logit-based choice model based on revealed preference data collected from the smart card records and the operational timetables. The choice model considers waiting time, fluctuating crowding levels, and passengers’ expected seat availability at each station on their trip. The revealed preference data are collected based on an existing time component framework, which can estimate passengers’ itineraries by dividing passengers’ travel time into time components (i.e. access, egress, boarding delay, and transfer-walking times) and analysing their uncertainty. We improve the time component framework by developing methods for estimating distributions corresponding to each time component. Using Chengdu Metro as a case, we find that the extra waiting time resulting from active boarding delay and standing time is valued 50.5% more positively and 25.3% more negatively than the in-vehicle sitting time, respectively. By comparing our findings with studies focused on passive boarding delays caused by fully loaded trains, we suggest that extra waiting time due to active and passive boarding delays should be explicitly distinguished in practice. The estimation results of the distributions for the time components indicate that access and egress walking times follow different distributions at given stations, as opposed to the assumption in most prior studies.}

The requirement for scalability, due to the possibly huge amount of involved sensors and devices, and the heterogeneous scenarios that might occur, impose resorting to sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques. In particular, multi-level simulation is regarded as a main framework that allows simulating large-scale IoT environments while keeping high levels of detail, when it is needed. We consider a use case based on the deployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level simulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive parallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of simulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on OMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which allows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on this use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies do represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized countrysides. Moreover, the performance evaluation confirms the viability of utilizing multi-level simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments.}

Addressing these problems can be difficult without significant building renovations and urban re-planning. This paper introduces a novel framework for the real-time enhancement of the local urban wind environment using motion-controlled billboards, or smart urban windcatchers, managed by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent. The DRL agent determines the windcatchers' optimal positions based on street-level sensor data, independent of meteorological data. The framework's effectiveness was assessed using a simplified city grid model, where two windcatchers aimed to optimize the pedestrian-level wind environment on a specific street. Simulation results indicated that the windcatchers could effectively alter the flow direction in the streets, promoting or diverting air passages per demand. The DRL agent also gave accurate instructions to the windcatchers under various weather conditions, achieving near-optimal wind environment scores. This paper introduces the conception and confirms the feasibility of the windcatcher system, laying the groundwork for future research—as it is much needed and welcomed—to enhance the system and overcome the acknowledged challenges in large-scale, real-world implementation.}

To date, sustainable development has been the most important discourse informing planning, a powerful rhetoric for solving environmental problems that shows confidence in human ingenuity and technological advancements. However, recent advances in information and communication technologies, are prompting the development of smart(er) approaches to (sustainable) development, which might be signifying a departure from the more traditional, or perhaps earlier, greener narratives underpinning sustainable development. Within this context and informed by analysis of the literature, this paper aims to reflect on the extent to which ideas of going green and going smart are converging or diverging from the path towards sustainable development. This is done using convergence theory and Bennet's typology (1991) of similarities as an analytical framework. The findings suggest that the convergence of greening and smart ideas for sustainable development might be better achieved if smart-centric approaches to policy- and planning are subsumed in the overarching vision of environmental quality and resilience, with green approaches to urban development setting the path and driving decisions towards a sustainable future.}

abstract = {The digitalization of cities and the development of smart, green, and integrated transport are societal challenges to transform cities into places with good quality of life now and in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) comes with new advances to connect a multitude of sensing devices and even actuators, and they are presenting the cornerstone of Smart City deployments worldwide. So far, these advances have focused on static sensors in scenarios such as gardens, smart lighting, climate monitoring, or traffic management. However, moving sensors could rise the monitoring capabilities of smart cities to the next level, helping to better reflect the status of large areas without replicating fixed stations. This work proposes taking advantage of urban vehicles and, especially, personal mobility vehicles (PMVs), to implement such a perspective. Hence, a low-cost and energy-aware onboard unit (OBU) is designed to gather environmental data and support sustainable mobility applications. This on-board platform is provided with Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) communication technologies, enabling an Internet connection following an IoT scheme. The unit is equipped with sensors to measure air pollution in terms of NO2, CO, SO2, O3 and PMx, noise, and weather parameters. While moving across the city, PMVs mounting this device can collect data in a crowdsensing scheme. This data feed is complemented by a set of wireless traffic sensors, and they are subject to intelligent processing to monitor pollution and mobility parameters. For this, a back-end software module is powered with temporal series analysis to generate predictions based on tendencies detected in both pollution and mobility values. A front-end Web application has been implemented to show all past, current, and predicted data, offering functionalities to monitor urban mobility, minimize travel times, detect pollution areas, and recommend healthy routes across streets with low contamination levels.}

Currently, law enforcement has exposed such problems as insufficient force, difficulties in collecting evidence, and low evidential power. These problems contradict the principles of rule of law and standardization. Many local governments have implemented advanced information technologies for urban administration and law enforcement, including big data, artificial intelligence, and IoT. Among these technologies, IoT is the core communication infrastructure for innovative law enforcement platforms. However, traditional video communications rely on batteries or dedicated power sources, leading to maintenance challenges and high power consumption. In this paper, we propose AT-Eye, a new video communication paradigm for all-time law enforcement video monitoring, which is battery-free and high-throughput. The key enabler of AT-Eye is ambient backscatter technology, which enables energy harvesting and video communication simultaneously. Unlike previous methods, our proposal introduces a novel CCK-based modulation for tag cameras and achieves 4-way concurrency. The modulation is simple because it uses phase difference and it is energy-efficient because generating square waves is adequate. Moreover, to ensure full compatibility with COTS WiFi, we modulate the physical service data unit. Therefore, data recovery is possible using only commercial NICs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to examine our proposal and experiment results show that AT-Eye achieves a throughput of 10.8 Mbps with COTS radios. We also simulate a 16-way battery-free tag camera system, demonstrating AT-Eye's feasibility of high-definition video communication.}

The study aims at the characterization of the environmental and economic sustainability of SMs in context to developing low-middle income countries like Pakistan. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methods have been used for the requisite analysis. While 6 midpoint categories; climate change potential (CCP), ozone depletion potential (ODP), terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TETP), fossil resource scarcity potential (FFP), water consumption potential (WCP) and 1 endpoint category; damage to human health have been selected. Highest impact scores have been determined in CCP, FFP, WCP i.e., 9.61E+00 and 7.60E+00 kg CO2 eq., 9.59E+00 and 7.77E+00 kg oil eq., 6.98E+00 and 6.69E+00 m3 water for CM and SM respectively. The overall highest impact is contributed by the production phase for both type of energy meters. In LCC analysis the initial cost of SM and CM has been calculated as 52.76 USD and 47.52 USD respectively, while the overall life cycle cost of SM is 61% less than that of CM. As such there are significant environmental and economic benefits of the deployment of SM as determined under the complete life cycle perspective. There is still a long lag to be covered by developing countries for the deployment of such smart-sustainable technologies. Policy interventions and roll-out programs can establish that SM not just an electricity metering system, rather is a comprehensive communication portal for buyers and sellers.}

These were guided by locally developed intelligent systems in information and communication technologies (ICT). One prime example of this rigorous structural change is the Ruhr Metropolis, a region in the Ruhr Valley, Germany. Over several decades, towns and cities in this region achieved new economic realities through the retrofit of entire city blocks and urban energy grids, the expansion of extensive public transportation networks, and the creation of innovation hubs for public–private collaboration on ICT development. Polluted brownfields were released for remediation and redeveloped into exciting new urban landscapes fit for living, working, and play. Public projects focused on restored ecosystems, urban regeneration, and socio-economic growth. The chapter traces the development history of the Ruhr and its responses to the German energy transition. Seen through three case studies, it delves into the social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by local authorities, the policies, strategies, and processes adopted, and the actors and collaborative techniques involved. The cases demonstrate the continual efforts by cities within a region that has benefited from numerous development phases and policy shifts at the local, regional, and state level. Key lessons are finally outlined to help guide other towns, cities, and regions around the world facing similar structural challenges.}

Lighting exceeds 70% of a port's energy demand in most cases. In parallel, they should be harmonised during the energy transition. This research proposes a novel replicable typology of smart-controlling the outdoor lighting infrastructures in three stages: the reallocation and replacement of the obsolete luminaires, the integration of the daylight harvesting techniques, and the implementation of the occupational-based dimming strategy based on the actual data. A typical Mediterranean port was used as a testbed, the port of Rethymno. The innovative aspect of the proposed typology is that it improves two existing smart lighting control techniques and combines them to a complete typology that responds fast and accurately to any possible lighting conditions' alteration in each space distinctively. The system incorporates high replicability and applicability to a great variety of needs, technologies, and spaces. The energy wastes are diminished while the end-used visual comfort is significantly enhanced. The system's energy savings potential and impacts on the port's infrastructures are quantified, discussed and evaluated. The suggested tool leads to a 56.8% decrease in the port's lighting operations' annual energy demand, which may reach up to 90% in some months. The port’s environmental footprint is also reduced to half than the baseline levels. In conclusion, the investment is viable and feasible, leading to an investment paid back in less than ten years in some instances.}

The analysis of technologies' status, barriers for market uptake, and potential future developments was translated into a technology roadmap, which outlined the time-dimension for technology maturity evolution and implementation impacts. The technologies developed within the ESGRIDS project can contribute to support consumers’ energy decision-making and to encourage them to have a more active role in the electricity market. Those technologies can also create job opportunities associated with the development of new products and services, and contribute to mitigating climate change by promoting the use of renewable energies thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to contributing to energy cost reduction by optimizing the use of supply and demand resources.

It further allows research into the technological and methodological aspects of emerging forms of urban data. Key highlights of the platform include a multi-topic household and person-level survey; travel and activity diaries; a privacy and personal device sensitivity survey; a rich set of GPS trajectory data; accelerometer, light intensity and other personal environment sensor data from wearable devices; an image data collection at approximately 5-second resolution of participants’ daily lives; multiple forms of text-based and multimedia Internet data; high resolution satellite and LiDAR data; and data from transportation, weather and air quality sensors. We demonstrate the power of the platform in understanding personal behavior and urban patterns by means of three examples: an examination of the links between mobility and literacy/learning using the household survey, a social media analysis of urban activity patterns, and finally, the degree of physical isolation levels using deep learning algorithms on image data. The analysis highlights the importance of purposefully designed multi-construct and multi-instrument data collection approaches that are driven by theoretical frameworks underpinning complex urban challenges, and the need to link to policy frameworks (e.g., Smart Cities, Future Cities, UNESCO Learning Cities agendas) that have the potential to translate data to impactful decision-making.}

These persistent parking problems could be turned into new opportunities, brought by current trends in meeting the globally connected continuum. This paper reveals a work-in-progress to capitalize on private land properties for parking, in order to relieve stress on public agencies, create new sources of revenue, and enlist new entities in the intermediary market. These intermediaries, labelled as Parking Service Providers (or PSPs) play a broker role through advertising parking lots on a shared cloud platform. To streamline these business collaborations and related processes, physical parking lots are augmented with Internet connectivity allowing cloud-provided applications to congregate these lots into a larger inventory. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm expands the scope of cloud-based intelligent car parking services in smart cities, with novel applications that better regulate car-parking related traffic. This paper presents a work-in-progress agenda that contributes to new business solutions and state-of-the-art research impacts. We reveal a multi-layered system of PSP-business model through interdisciplinary research blocks where original results are expected to be made at each layer.}

abstract = {To face the coexistence of the intended and unintended electromagnetic radiation in complex electromagnetic and harsh environment as well as minimize the secondary electromagnetic interference (EMI) pollution, the development of highly designable EMI shields for smart self-fixable EMI shielding with reduced reflection is of great importance. Herein, compressible shape-memory composite foams with strong structural designability have been fabricatd through a simple double dip-coating process, which could not only exhibit excellent shielding effectiveness (SE), but also achieve smart self-fixable SE adjustment under self-fixable compression originating from the ideal thermal/electrical-response shape-memory ability. More importantly, incorporating the concept of structural design, such as the construction of an asymmetric descending gradient structure or reasonable 3D patterns in the foams, could enhance the tunability of EM reflectivity effectively, which contributes to the reduction of EM reflection or even reverse the tendency of EM reflection to increase during the process of self-fixable compression-induced SE adjustment, thus minimizing the aggravated secondary EMI pollution significantly. The strategy and mechanism in this work highlights a significant plateau, on which smart self-fixable EMI shielding behavior with reduced reflection could be realized in highly designable shape-memory foam materials.}

abstract = {Smart technology brings convenience to our lives, and smart medical diagnosis plays a particularly important role in smart cities and the smart world. In smart diagnosis, high-quality image labels are essential for supervised medical image learning. The correctness of labels has a substantial influence on smart disease diagnosis. However, the labelling of disease images by professional doctors is a time-consuming and labour-intensive project; therefore, obtaining correct and high-quality labels is a difficult task. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based label completion and correction method (LCC) for supervised medical image learning in smart diagnosis. We use a small number of labelled images in a dataset to train a model, and design a strategy to complement most of the unlabelled data and correct noise label data, and then use the results of completion and correction to continually modify the model to achieve better results. We take the diagnosis of Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) and Flat Wart (FW) as examples; the experimental results show that this strategy can use limited labelled data to complete the labels for most of the unlabelled data and correct some noise labels in the dataset, which improves the accuracy rate of the model to identify diseases.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization and population growth worldwide seriously challenge building livable and sustainable cities. This increase causes the increase and diversification of urban sounds. They were transforming these sounds into information instead of just being heard, as noise plays an important role in the concept of smart cities. For this purpose, two basic methods are used to classify urban sounds. In the first of these, the sounds are processed by signal processing methods, and handcrafted features are obtained. In the other method, sounds are represented visually and classified with deep learning models. This study investigated the effect of the individual and hybrid use of features used in both approaches on the classification of urban sounds. In addition, a CNN model was created to classify hybrid features. The results obtained showed that both approaches produced successful results in classification. Among the visual representation methods, mel-spectrogram, scalogram, and spectrogram images achieved the highest classification success. Using mel-spectrogram and acoustic features and the SVM classifier positively affected accuracy. Experiments were performed on the ESC-10 and UrbanSound8k datasets. The highest accuracy for the ESC-10 was 98.33% when using the scalogram and acoustic features with the AVCNN model. The highest accuracy for UrbanSound8k was obtained as 97.70% by classifying the mel-spectrogram and acoustic features obtained from the AVCNN model with the SVM classifier.}

abstract = {Companies have made significant progress in decarbonizing product manufacturing, but transportation decarbonization lags as focus area. Battery advancements enable decarbonization in logistics through electric vehicle adoption. Yet, without managed charging, the total potential for freight electrification to reduce carbon emissions remains constrained. Using a route optimization and production reallocation model, this analysis demonstrates how fleet managers could actively reduce carbon emissions by up to 30% based on a Chinese case study. If data are available, the model could be applied to other countries and especially the international supply chains. Optimizing fleet charging in locations with the lowest grid emission factors achieves the greatest emission reductions. Companies seeking to decarbonize their logistics should explore novel fleet charging strategies. Meanwhile, cities with clean electric grids can attract electric vehicle charging and stimulate job growth, further incentivizing decarbonization of public utilities. This initiates a virtuous cycle of business-led emission reductions.}
