abstract = {This research introduces a novel integrated model with a comprehensive approach to develop and characterize smart cities. Strategic planning for sustainable and resilient cities has become an urgent necessity, given the global challenges around the environment and sustainable development. This paper answers the questions of what does a smart city look like and which parameters to prioritize in developing smart cities. This model incorporates important domains such as energy, environmental, social, governance and pandemic resilience domains in addition to other domains, carefully selected to ensure a wholistic approach. Each domain is assessed using four primary performance indicators, totaling 32 indicators, which are used to evaluate the smartness of a city. This conceptual framework is deployed and applied to 20 cities worldwide. Principal component analysis and further statistical assessments are used to determine the interrelationship and intrarelationships between the indicators of the various domains in order to determine a causal-effect matrix. The results show that the governance domain is strongly correlated with the energy and environment domains with the correlation coefficient (R) values of 0.86 and 0.87 respectively. There is a mild positive relationship between smart governance and smart society indexes. In fact, the R value of 0.7 highlights that smart governance does positively correlate and lead to smarter societies. The average smart energy index ratio is 0.26, which reflects immense opportunities for improvements in this sector. The half of the cities in the study are below average, while the other half exceed the average smart index ratio for the energy index. The smart governance index ratio is 0.44, and the cities vary on this front between 0.17 and 0.59. Montreal is the city with the highest smart governance index ratio, whereas Cairo has the lowest. This study provides the concept of smart city in a quantitative, empirical and comprehensive manner, highlighting that smart governance, smart society and pandemic resilience are critical aspects to the development of smart cities.}

In order to establish an ideal equilibrium between economic advancement and environmental preservation within contemporary and prospective urban areas, the Smart Sustainable City (SCC) approach becomes imperative. In this paper, our objective is to introduce the concept of the SCC and to examine potential scenarios that facilitate the realization of such an approach. Tehran, the capital of Iran, has encountered numerous challenges akin to those mentioned over the past fifty years, rendering it a pertinent case study for our investigative pursuits. Structural analysis tool (MICMAC) in this research as a method for futures studies used to exposes how a variable is influenced by and reliant on other variables by analyzing all the interactions within the city system. This paper suggests novel approach to MICMAC which promotes driving forces to scenarios. This helps in particular with SSC implementation and shows the consequences of not developing driving forces for the system by scenarios. Hence, the suggested approach might also be regarded as a novel addition to the field of futures studies. For this purpose, we evaluated the various factors that were most important for environmental sustainability and SSC implementation in Tehran. The results of this study indicate that Network-Based Services Providers, Application of Smart Social Services, Employing Smart Managers and Electronic backup management system by ICT Tools are driving forces which indicates the crucial influence of them in the implementation of SSC in Tehran. These driving forces were subsequently incorporated in three scenarios for 2030 being Smart Sustainable Tehran, Unregulated Tehran and Analog and Depleting Tehran.}

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

Herein, 21 typical blocks in Xi’an are applied as the research object, Mobike bicycle data, mobile phone signaling data and traditional survey data are employed. The correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis methods are used to identify the relationship between bicycle travel and land use. As a result, land use characteristics under the influence of bicycle travel are obtained. The results show that the land use indicators significantly related to street bicycle travel are composed of building mixing degree, floor area ratio and riding connectivity. Each index has a positive effect on street bicycle travel. The building mixing degree has the greatest impact on bicycle travel, followed by the floor area ratio and riding connectivity. In different periods, the impact of three indicators on bicycle travel varies. Especially, the impact on weekend bicycle travel is more obvious. This study can provide a reference for the optimization and transformation of land use in blocks under the influence of bicycle travel.}

As cities are the locus of the majority of global energy use, attention is increasingly being directed toward what can be done to improve the sustainability of urban energy systems. One solution receiving attention involves the increased use of decentralized energy supply resources, which reduce the distance between the point where usable energy is created and where it is ultimately consumed. This chapter examines these technologies in light of the limitations and challenges posed by the existing electric grid and the promise of the much-touted ‘smart grid’. The chapter presents a broader view of the urban energy system than is typically discussed, highlighting the role that shared thermal systems and electric ‘microgrids’ can play in providing a bridge toward a lower-carbon future.}

In order to implement a more sustainable energy management plan, it is crucial to conduct a better energy forecast. The next-generation smart meters can also be used to measure, record, and report energy consumption data, which can be used to train machine learning (ML) models for predicting energy needs. However, sharing energy consumption information to perform centralised learning may compromise data privacy and make it vulnerable to misuse, in addition to incurring high transmission overhead on communication resources. This study addresses these issues by utilising federated learning (FL), an emerging technique that performs ML model training at the user/substation level, where data resides. We introduce FedraTrees, a new, lightweight FL framework that benefits from the outstanding features of ensemble learning. Furthermore, we developed a delta-based FL stopping algorithm to monitor FL training and stop it when it does not need to continue. The simulation results demonstrate that FedraTrees outperforms the most popular federated averaging (FedAvg) framework and the baseline Persistence model for providing accurate energy forecasting patterns while taking only 2% of the computation time and 13% of the communication rounds compared to FedAvg, saving considerable amounts of computation and communication resources.}

Face images often change in posture, Angle, expression, makeup, aging, lighting, and other aspects. The performance of many models with high accuracy in restricted scenes decreases sharply in unrestricted scenes. Therefore, the study of face recognition in unrestricted scenes is of great significance. In this paper, we proposed a face recognition algorithm based on depth map transfer learning to effectively recognize face images taken in unrestricted environment.
Methods
Firstly, the deep network encoding and decoding structure based on dense feature fusion is used to extract depth information from face images. Secondly, depth information for migration learning is fused to improve the feature dimension of small sample data, thereby improving the problem of insufficient feature extraction training due to a small number of samples. Finally, in order to improve the classifier recognition performance in small sample machine learning, central loss is introduced into the traditional Softmax loss to improve the punishment supervision ability of the classification loss function.}

However, it imposes a big challenge to explore smart data from big data gathered from smart city with various advanced fusion and analysis approaches. This paper proposes an incremental tensor-based fuzzy c-means approach (IT-FCM) for obtaining smart data from continuously generated big data. Specifically, a weighted version of the tensor-based fuzzy c-means approach (T-FCM) is firstly proposed to cluster the dataset that combines the previous cluster centroids and the new generated data. Aiming to improve the clustering efficiency, the old data objects are represented by the centroids to avoid repeat clustering. Furthermore, this paper presents an edge-cloud-aided clustering scheme to fuse big data from different sources and perspectives and further to implement co-clustering on the fused datasets for exploring smart data. Finally, the proposed IT-FCM approach is evaluated by comparing with T-FCM regarding clustering accuracy and efficiency on two different datasets in the experiments. The results state that IT-FCM outperforms T-FCM in clustering streaming big data in terms of accuracy and efficiency for obtaining smart data.}

Similarly, Internet of Medical Things is gaining attention due to the current COVID-19 situation. It has gifted numerous sensors and devices with the increased accuracy, productivity and reliability to the healthcare industry. Increasing the sensor devices in smart city, results in the handling of large amount of data. Therefore, big data is focused due to their characteristics such as volume, variety, velocity and veracity. Extraction of hidden correlations and insights from data is performed through big data analytics or big data value chain. Such concepts are integrated with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies which are more important in collecting the real-time data collection and helps in gaining knowledge on how the smart cities and their applications in health sector evolves to adapt the conditions. The main advantage on Big Data Analytics is that it helps in commonality along with heterogeneity principles. Even though cities are digitalized, urban health is still limited to IoT devices which fetch sensor data, eliminating the inclusion of human anatomy and biological data. Integration of these two data forms will help in attaining the target of Big Data and leads to the contextualized, sustainable and resilient smart cities which renders more living factors.

abstract = {Studies have shown that drivers often spend over 20 min cruising for parking in city centers, accounting for as much as 30% of the traffic congestion. In response, cities like San Francisco have deployed systems capable of providing drivers real-time parking availability information. However, such systems rely on specialized infrastructure whose installation and maintenance costs in the tens of millions of dollars, unaffordable for many cities. We present SmartPark, a system for real-time parking information that relaxes the requirement for specialized infrastructure, relying instead on the smartphone’s sensors and the ubiquitous Wi-Fi and cellular infrastructure. To accomplish this, SmartPark addresses two major challenges, under the constraint of minimum impact on battery life: transportation mode detection and location matching. To minimize initial deployment cost and risk, SmartPark introduces an analytical approach for estimating parking availability even when only a small fraction of users adopt the application. We evaluate SmartPark using simulations and in the wild. Simulation results show that SmartPark, benefiting from as little as 20% adoption rate, can estimate parking availability with accuracy above 90%. Experimental results with the help of 12 volunteers show that SmartPark detects unparking events 97% of the time while triggering zero false positives.}

This system incorporated the self-powered flexible sensors with net-zero power consumption based on the Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) and an intelligent analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI). The feasibility of the SSTIS was tested using the full-scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model with a vehicle axle load classification accuracy up to 89.06%. This robust SSTIS was later tested on highway and collected around 869,600 pieces of signals data. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN - Gradient Penalty) was used for data augmentation, due to the imbalanced data of different vehicle types in actual traffic. The overall accuracy for on-road vehicle type classification improved to 81.06% using the convolutional neural network ResNet. Finally, we developed a mobile traffic signal information monitoring system based on cloud platform and Android framework, which enabled engineers to obtain the vehicle axle-load information mobilely. This study is the emerging design and engineering application of the self-powered flexible sensors for smart traffic monitoring, which provides a significant advance for intelligent transportation and smart cities in future.}

On the basis of this type of platform, numerous “collaborative entrepreneurship” initiatives have emerged in recent years, which have established themselves in cities, competing with services that already existed but providing them with greater flexibility and incurring in lower costs. Currently, most companies tend to outsource productive resources, taking advantage of the virtualization capacity of their jobs, thanks to the extensive coverage of connectivity networks deployed in cities. This situation facilitates the entry of new agents that can solve this growing demand into the market. In this chapter, we analyze the different business platforms capable of implementing compatible self-employment activities, to facilitate labor insertion through sustainable and quality self-employment that responds to the demand for services in cities.}

Regarding the methodological approach, this is a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. The obtained insights include: (a) Early adopters’ real-world AI applications in urban planning are paving the way to wider local government AI adoption; (b) Achieving wider AI adoption for urban planning involves collaboration and partnership between key stakeholders; (c) Big data is an integral element for effective AI utilisation in urban planning, and; (d) Convergence of artificial and human intelligence is crucial to address urbanisation issues adequately and to achieve smart and sustainable development.

Our objective is to support the delivery of the right information to the right person; and doing so in an adaptive manner that recognizes the needs of local context. We have developed a system that allows users to profile their information needs based on an ontology of user communications. Recommender algorithms are then used to match user profile to the most relevant knowledge items, such as documents, web pages, and tagged videos or images. Users who wish to rate or tag documents can do so through using concepts from the ontology or free text. If free text is used, semantic analysis is conducted to extract relevant tags. Tags are then fed-back into the recommender system to enhance its accuracy. Capturing community tags provides a good opportunity to use crowd input to contextualise the matching algorithms.}

Particularly with the increased focus on sustainability within smart urban governance, these futuring practices often rely on environmental monitoring technologies to guide reparative actions for environmental harms and promote multispecies justice. Yet, these futuring practices often overlook or are disconnected from the past where these environmental harms and injustices were sustained. Little attention has been paid to how smart urban governance might consider both past and future to better account for multispecies justice. This paper introduces a speculative design methodology within a reparative futures framework as it explores multispecies justice in smart urban governance. It reports on a methodological study conducted in Brisbane, Australia, in which participants—including policymakers, environmental lawyers, scientists, urban planners, and climate activists—undertook a speculative futuring design process intending to address past harms faced by multiple species and to repair relations within a more-than-human world. Direct engagement with the past in futuring practices helps us reflect on how smart urban governance might take accountability and institute better reparative actions to materialise multispecies justice.}

Previous studies over the decades leading up to the new millennium show human capital divergence across cities, where the share of college graduates grew faster in cities that had larger initial shares of college‐educated workers. However, labour markets have changed significantly post‐2000, likely affecting migration decisions of highly‐skilled workers. Additionally, past studies have not controlled for important changes in industry education levels and overall industry composition that may influence city‐level college graduate growth. We use detailed 4‐digit NAICS industry employment data combined with public micro‐data to construct measures of industry skill upgrading and changes in industry composition to control for their effects on human capital growth. We find agglomeration forces, rather than initial graduate share, explains college‐graduate share growth post‐2000. We also decompose graduates into bachelors and postgraduate degree holders to determine whether different forces are at play on growth of graduates at different education levels.
要約
地域政策当局は、経済成長の促進と活性化を狙って、長期にわたり高学歴労働者を引き付ける政策を模索してきた。西暦2000年までの数十年の間に行われた研究は、都市間の人的資本の多様性を明らかにした。当初から大卒労働者の割合の高い都市では大卒生のシェアは早く増大する。しかし、2000年代に入り労働市場は大きく変貌し、その変化が高度技能労働者の移住意思決定に影響を与える可能性が高い。さらに、従来の研究では、都市レベルでの大学卒業生の増加に影響を与える可能性がある、産業の教育レベルならびに産業の全体的な構成における重要な変化がコントロールされていなかった。我々は、人的資本成長に対する効果をコントロールするため、公開されているミクロデータと組み合わせた詳細な、NAICSコード4桁の産業分類の雇用データを使って、産業の技能向上と産業構成の変化に関する指標を構築した。当初の大学卒業生のシェアではなく集積力が2000年代の大学卒業生のシェア増加を説明することが示された。さらに我々は、大学卒業生を学部卒と大学院卒に分類して、学歴の異なる卒業生の増加には様々な要因の作用が存在するかどうかを検討した。
Resumen
Los formuladores de políticas regionales han tratado por mucho tiempo de atraer a trabajadores altamente cualificados con el fin de estimular el crecimiento económico y la vitalidad. Los estudios previos en las décadas anteriores al nuevo milenio muestran una divergencia en el capital humano por ciudades, según la cual la proporción de graduados universitarios crece más rápido en las ciudades con tasas iniciales mayores de trabajadores con educación universitaria. Sin embargo, los mercados de trabajo han cambiado significativamente después del año 2000, lo que probablemente ha afectado a las decisiones de migración de trabajadores altamente cualificados. Además, los estudios anteriores no han controlado los cambios importantes en los niveles de educación de la industria y la composición general de la industria que podrían influir en el crecimiento de graduados universitarios en cada ciudad. Se utilizan datos detallados NAICS de 4 dígitos del empleo en industrias combinados con microdatos públicos para el desarrollo de medidas de actualización de las cualificaciones en las industrias y de cambios en la composición de las industrias para el control de sus efectos sobre el crecimiento del capital humano. Se encontró que las fuerzas de aglomeración, en vez de las tasas iniciales de graduados, explicaron el crecimiento de la distribución de graduados universitarios posterior al año 2000. También se desagregaron los graduados de licenciatura y de posgrado para determinar si hay diferentes fuerzas en juego en el crecimiento de los graduados en función de los diferentes niveles de educación.}

As key-regulators of cities' micro-climate, urban trees suffer from this scarcity fueled by rising temperatures. With climate change on our doorsteps, cities turn to smart city concepts that harness advanced information technologies' potential to conserve scarce resources. Regarding withering trees, we suggest that a smart city should consider putting smart irrigation systems in place. We use a design science research approach to establish, demonstrate, and evaluate how a smart irrigation system for urban trees can be designed. In doing so, we describe how IoT and data analytics can be leveraged as the backbone of sustainable and smart irrigation. Our design is informed by theory and experts, including city administration representatives, IoT specialists, and botanists. A prototypical instantiation including 18 sensors at eight trees evaluates the design knowledge's viability in Frankfurt am Main (Germany). First insights into collected data in the pilot area indicate promising effects. Projected to the currently 5000 young trees in Frankfurt, we argue that water distribution within one round of irrigation in spring could be reduced by up to 1 million liters.}

Today cities are home to more than 50 per cent of the world population, the largest 600 urban centres generate about 60 per cent of global GDP, and the agglomerated areas are responsible for 75 per cent of world carbon emissions. The UN estimates that 70 per cent of the world's growing population will live in cities by 2050. At the same time the world population is expected to increase from 7 billion people to 9 billion. Thus, the total number of people living in cities will be almost doubled within a period of less than 4 decades.

Recognizing this challenge, governments globally are formulating cutting-edge strategies for urban renewal to ensure the long-term sustainability of cities. In this context, we employ a difference-in-differences model to scrutinize the intricate relationship between smart cities and the growth of renewable energy, utilizing the Chinese smart city pilot program as a pertinent experiment. This analytical approach provides novel insights into the underlying reasons behind this correlation. The research yields three noteworthy findings. Firstly, it underscores the indispensable role of pilot initiatives in smart cities for advancing the cause of renewable energy. Secondly, the study reveals a positive and beneficial interplay between creativity, economic inclusion, and the utilization of technological innovation in experimental urban programs, suggesting a potential multiplier effect. Thirdly, the local context significantly influences the impact of smart city pilots, with the dissemination of renewable energy being particularly effective in resource-rich, metropolitan, and coastal cities. Observable impacts of current smart city experiment on energy security and sustainable development are already apparent. The research findings contribute fresh perspectives to the complex challenges of sustainable energy production and urban planning, especially in developing countries like China.}

To achieve data analytics and decision making for energy systems in smart cities, we propose use fog computing to establish a smart community due to the reduction of bandwidth consumption and latency. However, privacy issues are emerging in this scheme because continuous attacks put sensitive information under great threats. Besides, the loss of sensitive information degrade the quality of data analytics and decision making. Motivated by this, we propose a differentially private smart community model with game theory-based personalized privacy protection (GPDP). Differential privacy is deployed in a personalized way while a logarithmic function is leveraged to map data sensitivity to privacy protection level. Then we use game theory to model the confrontation and further derive optimized trade-off, which is denoted by the Nash Equilibrium. In addition, we develop a modified reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve fast convergence. The advanced evaluation results show the advantages of the proposed model from the perspective of the optimized trade-off between personalized privacy protection and data utility, which improves data analytics and decision-making performances for energy management in smart cities.}

abstract = {In this work, the semi-arid region of northern India was selected to observe the contamination levels, scattering pattern, seasonal distribution, the ratio of low and high molecular density carcinogenic PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) in the roadside plants (Ficus benghalensis). Total 48 samples [DAV College Jalandhar (inside city) as well as CT Group of Institutions Jalandhar (outside city)] were collected during the year 2017 (within four varying seasons). In order to understand the distribution pattern of PAHs we applied, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis with Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR). The major resources of PAHs on roadside plants were the source of Petrogenic and Pyrogenic. Involvements of Coal Combustion Products (CCPs), automobiles exhaust emission and trickles of lubricate products (Petrogenic) were the key contributors with 36%, 36% and 28% using PCA/MLR, respectively. The mean concentration of total (low and high molecular weight) PAHs (Inside city) were 5.77 and 6.99 ng/m3 (1:1.44) whereas at outskirts of the city was 4.59 and 6.99 ng/m3 (1:1.93), respectively. Total PAHs mean concentration of PAHs (Inside city) was 105.81ng/m3, whereas in the outskirts of the city it was 97.34 ng/m,3 respectively. The results of total PAHs concentrations (Inside city), indicated that the 4-ringed carcinogenic PAHs were at alarmingly surpassing concentrations (i.e., 30.35 ng/m3), whereas, at city outskirts 4, 5, and 6-ringed hydrocarbons were found in elevated concentration (i.e., 28.49, 25.59, and 23.46 ng/m3). The Two-tailed t-test, ring distribution pattern and toxic equivalency factor were applied for the statistics significance of results.}

The present article critically presents the insights offered by Portuguese planners and public officials on how to craft policies aimed at regulating smart city initiatives in Portugal so that the best land use governance approaches can be identified for this country. Gathered through a mix of semi-structured interviews and an online survey, these insights indicate that planning should play a key role in regulating smart city initiatives, since much can be gained, but also lost, through these initiatives. The insights also show the extent to which smart innovations enjoy today a supposedly universalistic quality: even though Portugal is a peripheral country with very particular social, economic and geographic features, the participants in this research struggled to offer insights that were specifically related to the Portuguese context. This is critically assessed as an alarming sign of the digital colonization that contemporary imaginaries are experiencing.}

While smart cities affect many dimensions of city management, applications to safety management belong to the most controversial, revealing important tensions between disparate perspectives on technology and society in the context of urban living environments. Despite their influence, the concepts of smart cities and smart urban safety are largely unknown to the public. To gain insights into citizens’ perspectives, this study uses smart urban safety vignettes to which participants are invited to respond. Using discourse analytical techniques, their interpretations of safety in the smart city are described, which center on functional designs, express lacking influence over technological developments, and reflect on benefits and risks and on their civic roles vis-à-vis technologically mediated urban safety management. Our article concludes by arguing how these findings complement, but also show limitations to traditional technology acceptance models that are as of yet dominant in research of smart urban safety specifically, and smart cities more generally.}

However, little is known about the recipe for implementing and organizing a sustainable smart urban ecosystem. The bibliometric analysis and interpretive narrative review presented in this article found some contrasting perspectives on the approaches that should be embraced to run a viable smart urban ecosystem, shedding light into the manifold attributes of sustainable urban smartness. The research findings suggest that the viability of smart urban ecosystems relies on the ability of focal actors to implement a techno-bureaucratic governance model which relies on an integrated policy framework that accounts for the tripartite social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by cities. Citizen-centredness and greenness are the core values that embed urban smartness. Such values are useless if not backed by community engagement. Further developments should be targeted to unravel the role of datification and computerization in underpinning the collective intelligence of smart cities for the purpose of urban sustainability.}

In this study, a distributed proxy cache management platform based on autonomous decision is proposed. The platform realizes highly efficient automatic cache management by taking the advantages of autonomous perception and decision. First, the platform establishes the autonomous management framework of proxy cache on the basis of the idea of feedback loop. Next, the URL is distributed evenly among cache nodes through the hash ring storage mechanism with virtual nodes. Cache status adjustment strategies are made based on historical status sequences and the gray prediction model. A method that is used to predict content hot-rank based on domain name set is proposed to reduce loads of cache nodes. Second, the platform designs a distributed proxy cache management system by depending on the autonomous management framework of proxy cache and the cache management mechanism of autonomous decision, and the Cache Hot Spots Migrate algorithm is suggested for the dynamic migration and integration of virtual nodes on the hash ring. A system knowledge base is established through status sequence and corresponding adjustment strategies. Finally, experimental results on the hash ring, content hot-rank prediction, and adjustment of autonomous decision of cache status are analyzed, thereby confirming that the distributed proxy cache management mechanism based on autonomous decision could manage cache nodes effectively and automatically, and could improve the overall performance of the system.}

Smart cities require a decentralised and collective energy model in the form of renewable energy communities (RECs). This work aims to propose an economic analysis of residential photovoltaic systems within a REC according to different incentive and market scenarios. For this scope, the Net Present Value (NPV) is used in both baseline and alternative scenarios showing a very good profitability, confirmed by sensitivity, scenario and risk analysis. It is therefore evident how the avoided cost in the bill has a decisive impact on the result and how this is amplified by virtuous behaviour in consumption synchronous to the production phase. Subsequent analyses concern how the profits obtained are divided among the prosumers and it is shown that revenues shared according to a partial energy consumption profile may be the right compromise. In order to consider a more realistic case an additional consumer is analysed within REC. The proposed analyses show interesting policy implications: the subsidies and citizens behaviour are key factors for sustainable cities based on green energy production and consumption.}

This trend is accelerated by the increased demand and desire for safer, more reliable and more comfortable buildings under uncertain external loading and environment. Viscous, visco-elastic, hysteretic and friction dampers are representatives of passive dampers. Such passive dampers also play a key role in the implementation of structural rehabilitation which is essential for the realization and promotion of sustainable buildings. The technique of structural health monitoring is inevitable for the reliable and effective installation of passive dampers during the structural rehabilitation or retrofit. The design earthquake ground motions change from time to time when a new class of ground motions (e.g. long-period ground motions due to surface waves) is observed or a new type of damage appears during severe earthquakes. The concept of critical excitation is useful in responding to this change together with the usage of passive dampers from the viewpoint of sustainable buildings and cities. In this paper, a historical review is made on the development of smart or optimal building structural control with passive dampers and some possibilities of structural rehabilitation by use of passive dampers are discussed.}

This article seeks to investigate which factors influence the acceptance of smart meters by consumers in Brazil to provide insights into public policies that help in smart meter implementation projects. This work features a survey (N = 144) in the city of Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina, that comprises items derived from research and technology acceptance models, mainly the UTAUT2 model. PLS-SEM method is used to assess the influence relations on acceptance and the moderation of these relations by gender, age, and years of formal education of respondents. Social Influence is estimated as one of the main factors for the acceptance of smart meters in Florianópolis, something not foreseen in previous research on this topic. Another surprising result is the lack of influence from Performance Expectancy.

Therefore, enabling smarter and resilient cities is one of the key goals to tackling world challenges and ensuring the citizen’s wellbeing in the years to come. Various frameworks of indicators have been proposed to evaluate urban smartness with an aim to improve policymakers' actions. Nevertheless, recent research shows that despite efforts and initiatives, urban policy actions have yet to achieve the expected results, as smartness is evaluated in an aggregated way, while metropolitan areas are very heterogeneous systems. In this paper, the authors propose a methodological approach to evaluate smartness while considering a city not as a homogeneous space, but as a space divided into different districts with different characteristics and dynamics, and therefore different topologies and citizen needs. This methodology is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which sets out to measure the performance of decision-making units (districts) by considering the efficiency of each district, measured by the ratio between its allocated resources (input) and the corresponding smartness score (output). Accordingly, the methodology is highly applicable to cities located in emerging countries, which are characterised by a high disparity of human conditions if we compare them district by district. The approach is illustrated in a case study of the smartness of the metropolitan districts of Santiago de Chile.}

abstract = {The problem of minimizing the overall travel time, considering the one spent at charging stations, with the aim to improve the cruising range for Electric Vehicles (EVs) in road networks, is examined in this paper. Since the battery capacity of EVs is limited, it is inevitable for them to stop at charging stations. As they are lacking and the recharging process is time-consuming, an efficient route planning is essential. This paper extends a previously presented approach, i.e., EVRC (Electric Vehicle Route Planning with Recharging). In detail, the solution presented in this work considers a set of factors into account simultaneously and introduces a functional approach that estimates time-optimal routes for road networks with realistic models of charging stops. The key features include the efficient computation of the recharging station’s locations, the battery charging amount under a partial charging scheme, the nonlinear charging functions, and the service time duration at recharging stations. The experimental results highlight that the proposed approach outperforms other similar methods in facing the same problem. The extensive experimental evaluations show that refusing partial charging and neglecting nonlinear charging, as well as servicing time, may generate some infeasible or too costly solutions.}

In this scenario, it is essential, at this point, to draw the portray of the Portuguese awareness concerning intelligent waste management existing projects and evaluate the population's receptivity to these implementations. To obtain the data from the public, an online questionnaire was implemented, and 626 responses were obtained.

As there is an increasing interest in shipping goods by container, and that delivery points can be far from railways in various areas of interest, it is important to evaluate techniques for managing container transport that involves several days. The time horizon considered is a whole working week, rather than a single day as in classical drayage problems. Truck fleet management companies are typically interested in such optimization, as they plan how to match their truck to the incoming transportation order. This planning is a relevant both for strategical consideration and operational ones, as prices of transportation orders strictly depends on how they are fulfilled. It is worth noting that, from a mathematical point of view, this is an NP-Hard problem. In this paper, a Decision Support System for managing the tasks to be assigned to each truck of a fleet is presented, in order to optimize the number of transportation order fulfilled in a week. The proposed system implements a hybrid optimization algorithm capable of improving the performances typically presented in literature. The proposed heuristic implements an hybrid genetic algorithm that generate chains of consecutive orders that can be executed by a truck. Moreover, it uses an assignment algorithm based to evaluate the optimal solution on the selected order chains.}

The methods used in the work included landscape connectivity, minimum cumulative resistance model, Gravity model, Kernel Density Analysis, and Circuit theory. Through these methods, the ecological and cultural landscape networks were constructed, forming a composite network of green infrastructure by organic coupling of node composite, construction of composite landscape corridor, and corridor composite. The results showed that the subjective analysis and landscape connectivity analysis were used to quantitatively evaluate the importance of patches, thus selecting the superior ecological nodes. The minimum cumulative resistance analysis and gravity model were used to extract the GI corridors and their importance, respectively, with ecological landscapes constructed. Kernel density analysis and circuit theory could determine the cultural landscape nodes and extract cultural landscape corridors. Node composite, composite landscape corridor construction, and corridor composite are important methods to couple the composite green infrastructures. Compared to traditional ecological network, it can protect regional culture and ecology.}

More recently, similar techno-utopian enclaves are being planned in North America, including Union Point, a smart city project south of Boston announced in 2017. We use the case of Union Point to think through why public and private actors with conventionally competing interests, including local governments, international technology companies, and real estate developers, are collaborating enthusiastically to create smart mega-developments. This alignment of interests in the use of ‘tech’ to engineer the ‘city of the future’, and the pervasive idealism, entrepreneurialism, and ‘high-risk, high-rewards’ attitudes that enable ‘instant’ smart mega-developments, is characterized by what we term ‘unicorn planning’. This article connects Union Point to the global phenomenon of tabula rasa smart city developments and suggests that Union Point reproduces problems of earlier smart city experiments built from scratch in the Middle East and Asia. We critically examine local officials' susceptibility to being seduced by smart city rhetoric, and highlight their troubling willingness to cede public land, power, citizen privacy, and data governance to corporate actors in their entrepreneurial quest to create an instant ‘tech’ hub.}

This study, however, uses the 1990 Massachusetts census data to test four mechanisms at the microgeographic levels, in the Boston metropolitan area labor market. We propose that individual workers can learn from their occupational and industrial peers in the same local labor market through four channels: depth of human capital stock, Marshallian labor market externalities, Jacobs labor market externalities, and thickness of the local labor market. We find that all types of human capital externalities are significant across census blocks. Different types of externalities attenuate at different speeds over distances. For example, the effect of human capital depth decays rapidly beyond three miles away from block centroids. We conclude that knowledge spillovers are very localized within a microgeographic scope in cities that we call, “Smart Café Cities.”}

Wherever, streets are congested with cars and the need of cost-effective system is increasing in order to reduce the traffic jam impact.

If we can take advantage of the free space in each car, this will lead us to its best use with an optimal equation for achieving: fewer cars in the streets with more number of passengers. In this context, our mobile application “Where are you ?” is proposed as a solution that can help solving traffic jam problem. “Where are you ?” is a real-time application, which connects for free people living in the same city and having the same travel needs. Users ride-share their cars, based on the GPS position of the requester, the system searches the nearest and available car on the way of the requester. The system provides feedback and favorite driver's features, so that will help to recommend the best available driver. Our system is developed for android phones. It is considered as a social media since it provides communications between individuals or groups. Our application is based on trusted users. Users are authorized to register as part of a university or a company group or validated by their administrator. A “female only option” is also provided by the system. Our application is environmentally friendly because it provides carpooling service, which reduces carbon emissions, traffic jam, and the need for parking spaces.}

New transport technologies create opportunities and challenges for English cities to move towards a more sustainable and integrated future. Smart governance and interventions in the English metropolitan areas are reviewed to provide a background of the smart city and transport development in the UK. Despite the increasing commercial and political attention, there is still a lack of understanding and proposals for a robust framework to evaluate the smart transport system. It is challenging to build a toolbox that suits both academics and practitioners when developing transport interventions and investments. This paper proposes a comprehensive and up-to-date framework to assess smart transport development in cities. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify the most used indicators and important indices. New indicators that illustrate trending themes are added to the existing toolbox. In total, 49 indicators are listed in this study, including five new ones. We also show several aspects and the overall performance in the new evaluation framework by aggregating indicators into indices in the following groups: 1) private, public and emergency transport indices; 2) accessibility, sustainability and innovation indices; and 3) a composite index. The new evaluation framework is applied in eleven English metropolitan areas. The empirical results show that Greater London has the best development in smart transport, followed by West Midlands and West of England. The findings can provide useful insights for metropolitan authorities and their transport authorities when key devolution strategies are in place and substantial investment packages are considered.}

The data obtained from IoT is rapidly processed in various domains for the achievement of smart cities and societies. However, in many cases, applications are not contextualized by using data from outside the domain but are only contextualized using data from the domain itself, missing the opportunity for further contextualization. The lack of common criteria for the integration of data from different application domains is one of the main reasons that significantly hinders the integration of third-party data into real-time processing and decision-making systems and thus, the context awareness of developed applications. Although the use of several taxonomies and ontologies for context awareness in various application domains have been proposed, in many cases they are highly domain specific and/or difficult to integrate with other systems, which makes it challenging to facilitate data sharing between different systems and their processing to achieve enhanced context awareness. We aim to contribute to the addressing of these limitations through a reusable and extensible multi-domain taxonomy targeted to collaborative IoT and smart environments, which is also automatically integrated into a software architecture with real-time complex event processing technologies. The proposed solution has been illustrated through a case study and performance tests have been carried out in different computing capacity scenarios, showing its feasibility and usefulness.}

Reducing the operational costs of power generation and emission dispatch can both be accomplished with the integration of renewable energy sources. A power system is made to manage the fluctuating nature of loads for a brief time, nevertheless. However, new difficulties arise for utilities as a result of the fluctuation and uncertainty associated with renewable sources. Another problem faced by generating plants is network reliability issues arising from the peak hour's power demand in the power system. Application of demand response technology with the help of smart meters connected at consumers' end in smart cities can help to ease the enormous peak-hour pressure on power generating units. But a hybrid power system integrated with a storage system faces the challenge of optimal utilization of the battery under uncertainties caused by intermittent generation of power and dynamic demand. This research work proposes a real-time price based hidden Markov model and an enhanced demand response technique to solve these issues in a hybrid power system. Proposed model is tested on IEEE 30-bus system with/without renewable energy sources and implemented grasshopper optimization algorithm for optimal scheduling of generating units.}

In this work, the retrieval of the urban albedo and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 7 satellite data is performed over a selected area of a town in Central Italy (Terni), exhibiting a significant urban change during the last 10 years. Comparing two satellite images on 2005 and on 2015, the spatial pattern of albedo and LST shows an average albedo decrease of 0.03 during this period and a daytime SUHI increase of 2.3°C. As highlighted by a focused local scale analysis, built-up area modifications moved towards both a reduction and an increase of the surface albedo, comparing the previous situation of the area and the reflective properties of materials chosen for the new settlements or refurbishments. The proposed analysis with remote sensing data may be considered an effective indicator able to point out if urban changes like interventions and new constructions move towards an urban sustainable development in terms of SUHI mitigation.}

However nowadays hydrogen feed-in has to be limited to certain percentages in order to keep the characteristics of the resulting gas mixture (i.e. heating value) within the national standards. For P2G plants in urban areas this can strongly impact the economic viability. This paper investigates the use of on-site storage and model predictive controller (MPC) to ease the negative effect of restrictions in the gas and power grid on the economics of P2G systems. Three different use-cases for P2G in an urban setting are considered: Optimal utilisation of renewable electricity produced within the boundaries of the city, optimised electricity purchase at the spot market and optimal usage of electric network. MPC is compared to an optimised rule-based control approach. Results show that both controls can be used to meet the objectives and operate the power-to-gas plant. However, the MPC approach results in a smoother operation of the plant and significantly improved economic performance in all cases and is recommended. The results indicate the beneficial effects of on-site hydrogen storage on system operation and economics. For the investigated cases a storage capacity around 6 full load hours of the electrolyser was sufficient to improve results significantly.}

abstract = {The impact of smart transportation policies on carbon emission control has become a new issue in urban development. Existing literature has primarily focused on smart transportation technology and new energy vehicles, while ignoring the impact of smart transportation policies. By using a quasi-natural experiment from China, this paper analyzes the impact of smart transportation policies on urban carbon emissions. The impact mechanism is analyzed from the perspectives of vehicle intelligence, road intelligence, and cloud; the empirical analysis of spatial difference is based on the panel data of 285 cities in China. The results show that: (1) smart transportation policies and vehicle-road-cloud collaboration have a positive inhibitory effect on urban carbon emissions. (2) The inhibitory effect of smart transportation policies on urban carbon emissions is influenced by the level of urban economic development but not by transportation infrastructure. (3) The spatial spillover effect of smart transportation policies on urban carbon emissions is influenced by transportation technology. Cities with higher transportation technology capabilities show inhibitory effects, while cities with low transportation technology capabilities show promoting effects. This study provides a reference for the sustainable development of urban smart transportation systems and environmental management.}

abstract = {The electrical power sector must undergo a thorough metamorphosis to achieve the ambitious targets in greenhouse gas reduction set forth in the Paris Agreement of 2015. Reducing uncertainty about demand and, in case of renewable electricity generation, supply is important for the determination of spot electricity prices. In this work we propose and evaluate a context-based technique to anticipate the electricity production and consumption in buildings. We focus on a household with photovoltaics and energy storage system. We analyze the efficiency of Markov chains, stride predictors and also their combination into a hybrid predictor in modelling the evolution of electricity production and consumption. All these methods anticipate electric power based on previous values. The main goal is to determine the best method and its optimal configuration which can be integrated into a (possibly hardware-based) intelligent energy management system. The role of such a system is to adjust and synchronize through prediction the electricity consumption and production in order to increase self-consumption, reducing thus the pressure over the power grid. The experiments performed on datasets collected from a real system show that the best evaluated predictor is the Markov chain configured with an electric power history of 100 values, a context of one electric power value and the interval size of 1.}

The collected data was analyzed using positive matrix factorization (PMF), a well-known multivariate receptor model to predict the major sources of air pollution. The PMF resolved four dominant pollution sources/factors: petroleum/solvent extraction activities, vehicular emissions, fertilizer industry, and mining activities. More specifically, the petroleum industries contributed to emission of VOCs; vehicular emissions contributed mainly to CO, NO, NOx, and NO2; fertilizer related activities dominated in emission of NH3 and SO2; and mining activities were observed to be associated with emissions of PM10, PM2.5, and O3. Moreover, trajectories analysis (backward and forward) were performed using HYSPLIT model, which revealed that the wind direction and wind speed played significant role in varying concentrations of monitored pollutants. Overall, the present study provided a new insight for the source apportionment of monitored pollutants.}

The study begins with a review of the current and potential future demographic and energy trends for London. This is followed with detailed energy analysis of three different thermal network configurations to identify the most viable thermal network configuration for London. Future projection analysis was also carried based on a number of potential building mix scenarios. The study revealed that by using thermal network with heat recovery produced significant energy savings and subsequent carbon savings by upto 56%. The majority of the energy saving and equivalent CO2 emission savings resulted from the reduction of the heating energy required to cater for the loads due the viability of heat recovery from the cooling network into the return of the heating network. The study also revealed that by utilising thermal networks, with central energy centre approximately 1831 tonnes of CO2 equivalent could be saved per annum compared to traditional supply methods. With a minimum assumed system life of 25 years this equates to approximately 46,000 tonnes CO2.}

The i-NEXT hydrogen production plant is located in the Municipality of Capo d’Orlando, Sicily, it is fed by a microgrid able to receive energy from solar radiation by a 100 kW rooftop photovoltaic plant and connected with a battery energy storage of 300 kWh (composed by 16 sodium nickel chloride high temperature batteries). The plant is able to deliver hydrogen and electricity for an electric and hydrogen vehicles fleet. The hydrogen fueling station includes four subsystems: a hydrogen production system by electrolysis, a compression system, a high-pressure storage system and a hydrogen dispenser for automotive applications. It is able to generate in the hydrogen production subsystem through an alkaline electrolyzer of 30 kWh: 6.64 Nm3/h of H2 with a gas purity of 99.995% (O2 < 5 ppm and dew point < −60 °C). The compression subsystem has a three stage compressor with a rated gas flow rate of 5,2 Nm3/h and a delivery pressure of 360 bar. The compressed H2 gas is stored in a high-pressure tanks of 350 L capacity allowing, in this way, a supply through a dispenser system of two automotive's tanks of 150 L @ 350 bar in less than 30 min.

In this sense, this article aims to identify the development of technological drivers of Smart Energy, map collaborative networks among these drivers, and discuss best management practices for establishing collaborative relationships. The research was developed from a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis carried out with the aid of statistical software. Six key drivers and 20 collaborative drivers were identified. These drivers integrate four collaborative networks structured to offer an understanding of how energy systems are organised under the concept of Smart Energy. From this, the article provides insights into the development, implementation, and management of these networks and drivers to accelerate the diffusion of Smart Energy to users at all levels.}

The fusion of IoT, ICT, and Smart Home delivers interactive solutions to reduce costs and resource consumption, enhance performance, and engage people's needs more virtually and proactively. A smart home has numerous advantages with the integration of emerging advanced technologies. Big data, centralization, data and resource allocation, security, and privacy issues persist as challenges in IoT-enabled Smart Home Networks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a GRU-based Digital Twin Framework for Data Allocation in IoT-enabled Smart Home Networks. Data and resource allocation of smart home applications are completed at the virtual twin layer using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based Digital Twin Networks. Low-priority data is stored and processed at the Macro-based Stations (MBSs), and high-priority data is transferred to the upper (Security) layer for authentication and validation. Blockchain-based distributed networks are utilized for Smart Home Data authentication at the security layer with a Proof of Authentication (PoAh) Consensus Algorithm; Data is stored at the cloud layer after validation. The validation results of the proposed framework demonstrate superior performance as the quantitative analysis with accuracy 0.9412, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.0588 for IoT-enable Smart Home compared to existing works as LSTM-based Digital Twin network and provide a secure environment in IoT-enabled Smart Home.}

A huge number of applications are in need of such control methods for good audio communication, etc., and the most widespread method for achieving this is through COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) based on QRD-RLS. However, this method requires several iterations for its calculations, and therefore in order to reduce the complexity of the calculations and for faster calculation with a minimum number of iterations, a modified CORDIC based on the QRD-RLS algorithm for the purpose of beamforming is proposed in this paper and named mixed scaling rotation coordinate rotation digital computer (MSR-CORDIC). In this work, beamforming and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation will be achieved using the MSR-CORDIC and MUSIC algorithms respectively. The proposed algorithm is developed using Verilog HDL and implemented using the Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In all cases, the proposed algorithm shows remarkable improvement compared with the conventional SCC (space code correlator) beamforming algorithm.}

The main objectives of this study were to collect renewable energy resource data of a hybrid hospital, use the average amount of hospital waste from the literature and NASA surface meteorology in addition to the solar energy database from HOMER Pro software to construct a hybrid model for a conceptual hospital in the new green city in Saudi Arabia, NEOM. The hybrid model consisted of biogas cofire and diesel generators, PV solar array and batteries. Simulations were performed to analyse the load requirements of a standalone hospital. The mechanism of energy storage was designed based on Tesla batteries. Then, the hybrid hospital model was tested with NEOM’s natural resources, load demand of 250 kWh/day and the average amount of daily hospital waste of 0.6 tons based on the literature data. This condition allows the smart hospital to be tested with real features. The outcome of the COE, NPC and the amount of reduction of carbon dioxide in the hybrid hospital were analysed. Many of the hybrid properties and constraints that define the hospital were adopted from previous literature concentrating on similar domains. The optimal solution of a hybrid micro grid consisted of biogas cofire, PV array, and batteries. Of the total load demand, 32.3% and 67.6% were produced by PV array and biogas cofire generators, respectively, together with eight Tesla PowerWall2.0 batteries. The cost of energy was 0.21 USD/kWh and the net present cost was 243,699.17 USD. In this study, we compared renewable energy with conventional energy and found that the optimal solution would be able to reduce carbon emission and diesel consumption by almost 84% and 81%, respectively. The results were verified through a sensitivity study and compared with other studies.}

It also facilitates the construction of an eco-friendly environment in the society by optimized route planning of vehicles. However, framing dynamic pricing strategies for ITS has always been a challenging task keeping in view of various constraints. An in-efficient dynamic pricing technique may lead to the mismanagement of vehicles, which results an increase in the waiting time of vehicles, an increase in air and noise pollution, wastage of electric and other sources of energies. On the contrary, efficient dynamic pricing strategies can provide satisfaction to all stakeholders, including service providers and service consumers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents an extensive literature review and analysis of dynamic pricing techniques used in the literature for ITS. The analysis presented in the paper gives new insights to the readers for the applications of one of the techniques in comparison to its merits over the others. Various problems solved by the dynamic pricing techniques, importance of various evaluation parameters, limitations of dynamic pricing techniques and their applications are discussed in-depth in this paper. Different taxonomies used for exploring various issues of dynamic pricing are also presented in a structured manner. Moreover, advantages and limitations of various dynamic pricing techniques are explored and discussed in the paper. Finally, existing challenges and future research directions of dynamic pricing in ITS are presented.}

Technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (XAI), and data mining are all helping to transform education in a smart city by allowing for personalized learning and the ability to tailor content based on individual preferences. Based on the combination of XAI and IoB technologies, this study proposes a new paradigm for smart educational systems. Using data on students' actions, researchers try to establish whether or not contemporary educational systems meet students' needs. Education systems have evolved, but not to the point where they can be personalized to meet the cognitive demands of students and assist them when face-to-face instruction isn't available. Using evaluation methods, the study found that there has been a shift in students' academic progress when monitoring using IoT/IoB to enable a relative response in support of their progression. The system response to learners was 37%, once we involve the IoB in the processes and let students and the system be aware of the collected and used data about students' behaviours, the student's response improved to 76 % . This indicates the major influence of IoB on learner assistance and system adaptations to their real demands for higher achievement.}

Among the smart improvements, smart city holds the highest rank due to the initiatives provided by the administration. Smart city mission has influenced the citizen’s life with respect to the automation on fundamental needs. Energy resources are considered as one of the important requirements for the survival of people. With the advent of Internet of Things, smart grid systems are designed in order to meet the sustainable demands. It also provides information about the energy resources consumed and alert the consumers about the demand prevails on the resources. Technological improvement is more essential for a country, only if it can be considered and adaptable for sustainable development. Therefore these papers outline the Internet of Things based smart grid which helps in the energy conservation process to meet the future demands. Energy management processes has to be well-versed among the citizens as it helps in understanding the possible ways on storage of energy resources. However, when energy storage is concerned, security issues are the counterpart which has to be focused at higher level. Therefore, blockchain techniques applied for energy storage systems are also outlined along with the applications and future directions of smart grid.}

abstract = {Aiming at the existing problem of losing spatial details and spectral information in remote sensing image fusion, a method of remote sensing image fusion based on convolution sampling transformation is proposed. Firstly, two images to be fused are convoluted, sampled, filtered hierarchically, and decomposed into different sub-images at different levels. Next, those sub-images are fused according to the corresponding locations, and then reconstructed to be a fused image. For images with more complex terrains and objects, the requirements for spatial details and spectral information are higher. So we propose to further transform the fused image and panchromatic image in space. The first component of the former is replaced by that of the latter. Finally, the fused image is obtained after performing inverse transformation. The experimental results show that the fusion effect of two proposed methods is better than that of traditional image fusion algorithms, such as PCA transform, HIS transform, wavelet transform and so on. Compared with the previous method, the latter method has higher resolution but less spectral information in the case of more complex terrains and objects for two proposed methods. They are effective remote sensing image fusion methods.}

The layout of ecological corridor can reduce the harm of landscape fragmentation caused by the rapid development of cities, especially in the arid area of Loess Plateau, which is of great significance to strengthen the connectivity of ecological patches and restore the service function of ecosystem. In this paper, taking Sanshui River Basin in Xunyi as the research object, from the perspectives of production, life and ecology, based on the landscape ecology research paradigm of “patch-corridor-matrix”, the ecological source is determined, the ecological corridor is identified and constructed by the method of overlapping ecosystem services and ecological sensitivity, and finally the spatial structure of ecological corridor network in Sanshui River Basin is obtained. The results show that 65 core ecological patches can be selected as key ecological sources in Sanshui River Basin. It is identified that 75 ecological corridors form an ecological corridor layout mode of “green corridors are coherent and loops are interconnected”; According to the layout of ecological corridor, the spatial structure of ecological corridor network can be formed as “one heart, one vertical and three horizontal”. The research can improve the ecological stability of Sanshui River Basin, promote the construction of ecological civilization in Sanshui River Basin, and provide scientific basis for the optimization of rural ecological space in small watershed scale.}

This availability of data enables the potential use of geo-located content as an additional, low-cost and infrastructureless source of information for urban sensing in smart cities. All these aspects along with the need for real-time analytics for urban sensing, take us to Big Data management and its related issues. Real-time urban sensing uses citizens as active and passive sensors and can reveal important insights about human behavior in the city. A systematic literature review outlines related works and gaps in current research. In this chapter, we propose a reference model to exploit Big Data for urban sensing and we validate it using a case study. Finally, we give recommendations for future research about location and mobility mining of social network data.}

Our system demonstrates how the severity of road traffic congestion can be smoothly analyzed, diagnosed, explored and predicted using semantic web technologies. Our prototype of semantics-aware traffic analytics and reasoning, illustrated and experimented in Dublin Ireland, but also tested in Bologna Italy, Miami USA and Rio Brazil works and scales efficiently with real, historical together with live and heterogeneous stream data. This paper highlights the lessons learned from deploying and using a system in Dublin City based on Semantic Web technologies.}
