abstract = {Cities are densely populated and heavily equipped areas with a high level of service provision. Smart cities can use these conditions to achieve the goals of a smart society for their citizens. To facilitate such developments, the necessary IT-infrastructure has to be in place for supporting, amongst many other things, the whole lifecycle of big data management and analytics for research activities. At the Centre for IT-Intelligent Smart Energy for Cities, we have therefore been developing a flexible infrastructure, based on open sourcetechnologies. This paper presents this solution and its application in a city and building research.}

abstract = {Several architectures namely Cloud, Fog, Mist, and Edge computing have been proposed for IoT systems, but efforts to practically correlate between them have proved hollow due to difficulties in creating live systems that replicate the frameworks. In this paper, a comparison of these architectures has been made. Simulation models have been developed to form an understanding of the variation in their performance for different values of configuration and workload parameters in a parallel multi-query processing environment. To derive realistic simulations for sensor-data, the Citybench smart city dataset has been used, which is extracted from measurements taken by traffic, temperature, and other sensors, along with a wide range of queries generated in a smart city application. By using seven highly contrasting single and six ratio based mixed Queries, it can be seen that Edge with proximity to query devices and sensors achieves the least latency in four of the single and five of the mixed query simulations with Mist being a close second in the same. However, Fog due to its distributed and high computational capability obtains minimum latency for two single query simulations with Cloud being best for compute-intensive cases.}

These sensors collect a massive amount of data, which is eventually used in the efficient management of shared assets and resources. In this article, we provide a framework for topological based map building for autonomous robot navigation in smart cities supporting IoT-based technologies. The classical methods of topological based map building do not incorporate the real essence of topology but instead, an illustration is provided where the topology is considered to be a cluster of features. We analyzed the problem of map building from a pure robotic perspective by considering the shape of free-space into a robot navigation path. In the proposed framework, shape-based invariant features are extracted from the free-space, which are used in the construction of topological nodes for robot autonomous navigation. In the context of topological navigation, topology is considered as a structural representation of connecting nodes representing free-space shapes and edges that define their connectivity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, real-time experiments are performed, which show improvements in autonomous navigation in terms of efficiency and maneuverability.}

It becomes the most attractive place for life and work for residents. At the same time, building an inviting place that meets the needs of city residents is a difficult task for local governments. Firstly to identify, and secondly to fulfil the citizens’ continuously changing needs. One of the easiest methods to help understand the residents’ needs can be crowdsourcing usage. However the most challenging area of responsibility is to manage traffic by the city logistics infrastructure designed to eliminate congestion problems within existing city spatial and, at the same time, to flexibly reply on transport changing demands. The answer to those challenges facilitating future Smart City logistics development is interoperable IT system usage based on cloud computing model. Similarly, cloud computing, by its design and characteristics, is particularly interesting for the public sector aiming to reduce costs and improve flexibility in operations. The cloud computing model gives unique opportunity to design city logistics infrastructure in the way that it is easily adaptive to changing transport demands. The main objective of the article is to present Smart City logistics on the cloud computing model (Cloud Smart City logistics) as the concept of citizens’ demand-driven flexible logistics infrastructure performance for the sustainable city of the future which is available for any city government interested in sustainable development.}

This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city’s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city’s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.}

abstract = {Integration of all smart systems (such as smart home, smart parking, etc.) and the IoT devices (such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones) in the city can play a vital role to develop the urban services by building their city digital and smarter. However, interconnection of lots of IoT objects to collect urban data over the Internet to launch a smart digital city, effects vast volume of data generation, termed as Big Data. Thus, it is a challenging task to integrate IoT devices and smart systems in order to harvest and process such big amount of real-time city data in an effective manner aimed at creating a Smart Digital City. Therefore, in this paper, we have established an IoT-based Smart City by using Big Data analytics while harvesting real-time data from the city. We used sensors’ deployment including sensors at smart home, smart parking, vehicular networking, surveillance, weather and water monitoring system, etc., for real time data collection. The complete system is described by its proposed architecture and implementation prototype using Hadoop ecosystem in a real environment. In addition, the Smart Digital City services are extended by developing the intelligent Smart Transportation System by means of big graph processing to facilitate citizens while providing real-time traffic information and alerts. The proposed system consists of number of stages including data generation and collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing, and decision making. The efficiency of the system is extended by applying Big Data processing using Apache Spark over Hadoop. Whereas, the big city graph processing is achieved by using Giraph over Hadoop. The system is practically implemented by taken existing smart systems and IoT devices as city data sources to develop the Smart Digital City. The proposed system is evaluated with respect to efficiency in terms of scalability and real-time data processing.}

A Smart City represents a new future framework, which integrates multiple information and communication technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, so as to improve the quality life of its citizens. However, there are many security and privacy issues which must be taken into account before the official launching of this new technological concept. Many methods which focus on media security of wireless sensor networks have been proposed and can be adopted in the new expandable network of IoT. In this paper, we describe the upcoming IoT network architecture and its security challenges and analyze the most important researches on media security and privacy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Subsequently, we propose an Efficient Algorithm for Media-based Surveillance System (EAMSuS) in IoT network for Smart City Framework, which merges two algorithms introduced by other researchers for WSN packet routing and security, while it reclaims the new media compression standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Experimental analysis shows the efficacy of our proposed scheme in terms of users’ privacy, media security, and sensor node memory requirements.

Semi-annular slots are introduced around a Bow-tie slot from the ground plane side, enhancing the bandwidth, gain, and CP characteristics. The antenna provides an impedance bandwidth (BW) of 2.89 GHz (5.45–8.34 GHz) and offers CP characteristics with an axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 680 MHz (5.67–6.35 GHz).

At the same time, studies about recessions examine primarily their reasons and consequences. Currently, there is no research examining the role of city technology as a strategic option for firms in a recession environment. To address this gap we develop a conceptual framework from studies of recessions and examine the case study of the IBM Smarter Cities initiative against this framework. Our case builds on interview and archival data. Our study offers two contributions. First, we offer an empirical examination of city technology from the perspective of stakeholders and actors who are tasked with the role to create and disseminate these technologies instead of the perspective of cities that use the technology. Second, we propose a strategic view to city technology and showcase the distinctive theoretical and empirical insights that future studies can develop by shifting the attention on the processes and practices inside the ICT organisations creating and disseminating these city technologies.}

However, few works consider data security when using MVs as data mules. In our previous work, we have proposed a Consistent Trust Verification for MVs (CTV-MV), which builts trust through recommendation relationships, but this method was vulnerable to collusion attack, that is, multiple MVs provided consistent fake data to deceive the system. Therefore, a Cross Trust Verification for MVs joint UAVs (CTV-MVU) data collection strategy is proposed in this paper, where the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to collect data from specific SDs which are used as baseline data to realize trust reasoning mechanism. Besides, the UAVs can also sense the SDs that are difficult to be collected by MVs due to their limitations of coverage, and thus improve the data collection ratio. Furthermore, a Trust Priority Recruitment (TPR) strategy for CTV-MVU is also proposed to prioritize the recruitment of high-trust MVs. Experiment results show that the proposed CTV-MVU strategy outperforms the CTV-MV one in terms of the excellent ratio, trust, data collection ratio, and robustness.}

Our framework uses text mining, text classification, named entity recognition, and stemming techniques to extract the intelligence needed from Arabic social media feeds, for effective incident and emergency management in smart cities. In our system, the data is automatically collected from social media feeds then processed to generate incident intelligence reports that can provide emergency situational awareness and early warning signs to rescue teams. The proposed framework was implemented and tested using datasets collected from Arabic Twitter feeds over a two-years span, and the obtained results show that Polynomial Networks and Support Vector Machines are the top performers in terms of Arabic text classification, achieving classification accuracy of 96.49% and 94.58% respectively, when used with stemming. The results also showed that the use of stemming led to a penalty in terms of response time, and that the richer the dataset/corpus used in terms of size and composition, the higher the classification accuracy will be.}

This as a result of poor management practice and implementation of strategies to avoid excess energy consumption. Over the years, researchers in both academia and industries have focused on various techniques to deal with unnecessary energy consumption and ensuring a healthy living environment for green smart cities. Among these techniques is Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMs), which transform electric home appliances, sensor nodes, into autonomous devices in order to manage energy consumption effectively. This study presents an analysis of smart home energy management system with the goal to identify current trends and challenges for future improvement. The result reveals lack of quality attributes such as security, privacy, scalability, interoperability, and difficulty in managing and adapt to the thermal comfort satisfaction of residents, exposing them to health risks.

To this end, local councils in Australia are applying digital technologies with increasing complexity as components of their urban forest management. This paper applies a more-than-human lens to analyse Australian local council urban forest policies, documents and project information for their inclusion and application of digital technologies. In this scoping review, digital geographies informed data collection to answer questions about the type, use and ownerships of tree data, and more-than-real and ‘lively data’ concepts were employed to extend their discussion. Our analysis found that local government policies focused on general urban tree data and canopy percentages and utilised this data to justify and create policy and program parameters. There was a general lack of more-than-human considerations beyond the focus on trees in creating and designing smart urban forests, but it is unclear whether this was due to technical limitations, council desires or other factors. Challenges identified for successful outcomes included balancing priorities, access to resources and information, technological constraints, and community factors such as capacity to engage and cultural values. Digital technologies that facilitate smart urban forests tended to reinforce and re-solidify Western values. However, strengths of current applications are also evident, and we explore how they provide more-than-real possibilities for human-nature relationships to deepen and foster collaborations between disparate groups and entities in urban environments. Greater consideration and acknowledgment of the more-than-human and understanding of the more-than-real in co-creation and co-design of digital technologies and their applications may facilitate more positive outcomes for human and non-human urban inhabitants.}

These values which are often visible in the advancement of the sharing economy and smart cities, may differ from the traditional public values protected by national and local laws and policies. This article contrasts the public values created by digital platforms in cities with the democratic and social national values that the platform society is leaving behind. It innovates by showing how co-regulation can balance public values with platform values. In this article, we argue that despite the value-creation benefits produced by the digital platforms under analysis, public authorities should be aware of the risks of technocratic discourses and potential conflicts between platform and local values. In this context, we suggest a normative framework which enhances the need for a new kind of knowledge-service creation in the form of local public-interest technology. Moreover, our framework proposes a negotiated contractual system that seeks to balance platform values with public values in an attempt to address the digital enforcement problem driven by the functional sovereignty role of platforms.}

With a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with commanders of two local police departments, this study investigated information orientation in the strategic decision-making process in the area of public safety in a small Brazilian city. The police departments have a limited ICT infrastructure to support the strategic decision-making process because their information systems are not connected. The results show that although the city of Pato Branco (Brazil) is considered a smart city in the area of public security, there are limited resources in several aspects of the police departments for the effective management of their ICT infrastructures. The impact of resource constraints reflects throughout the entire information use lifecycle - identification, collection, organization, processing, etc. - which fuels the strategic decision-making process. The implantation of an operations center could significantly reduce the effects of the problems identified in this research and further research may reveal the operational, technical, economic and financial viability of this proposal.}

The results of the analysis show that citizen e-participation, in providing service feedback, is positively associated with the clearance rate of urban service requests in subdistrict service units, after controlling for various factors. We also found that the effect size of e-participation on service performance varies between different types of city services.

The choice of the most suitable indicator framework is crucial, but difficult, as it requires expert knowledge. To help cities in their choice, this paper compares seven recently published indicator standards for Smart sustainable cities. A taxonomy was developed to evaluate each of their 413 indicators against five conceptual urban focuses (types of urban sustainability and smartness), ten sectoral application domains (energy, transport, ICT, economy, etc.) and five indicator types (input, process, output, outcome, impact). The results clearly discriminate between indicator standards suited for evaluating the implementation of predominantly smart city approaches versus standards more focused on sustainability assessment. A further distinction is possible in standards almost fully oriented towards impacts reached, and standards that allow for progress evaluation according to steps in the implementation process. Some standards provide a narrow focus on output indicators evaluating the progress in implementing smart urban ICT solutions (e.g. number of smart meters installed). Cities are encouraged to complement such evaluations with impact indicators that demonstrate the effects of those solutions. This paper provides guidance for city managers and policy makers to select the indicators and standard that best correspond to their assessment need and goals, and align with their stage in Smart sustainable city implementation.}

We explore this through a focus on a recent public library development in Australia where a high-profile new library features as a signature investment in the city's broader digital and ‘smart city’ strategies. In analysing the library's entanglement with the digital visions of this city, our case study reveals the uneven and often contradictory impacts that characterize the digital economy. We argue that the articulation of a technology-led agenda with neoliberal governance settings has produced institutional tensions that go to the core of the library's role in public life, challenging us to consider how libraries might best serve a range of rapidly changing and competing needs and publics. We find that while libraries have been forced to make certain changes, they have also developed proactive responses to new technology. Efforts to reinvent themselves as ‘hubs’, ‘makerspaces’ and co-located community centres offering enriched spaces for social gathering, targeted learning, and new forms of creative production, including entrepreneurial activity and innovation, are strategies for maintaining and extending the traditional remit of the public library. However, these transformations are not adequately recognised within the structures through which libraries are evaluated and funded, thus making them vulnerable to future governmental agendas.}

It represents an urban model, refers to all alternative approaches to metropolitan ICTs case to enhance quality and performance of urban service for better interaction between citizens and government. However, the smart cities based on distributed and autonomous information infrastructure contains millions of information sources that will be expected more than 50 billion devices connected by using IoT or other similar technologies in 2020. In Information Technology, we often need to process and reason with information coming from various sources (sensors, experts, models). Information is almost always tainted with various kinds of imperfection: imprecision, uncertainty, ambiguity, we need a theoretical framework general enough to allow for the representation, propagation and combination of all kinds of imperfect information. The theory of belief functions is one such Framework. Real-time data generated from autonomous and distributed sources can contain all sorts of imperfections regarding on the quality of data e.g. imprecision, uncertainty, ignorance and/or incompleteness. Any imperfection in data within smart city can have an adverse effect over the performance of urban services and decision making. In this context, we address in this article the problem of imperfection in smart city data. We will focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration and we will create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. The expected outcomes from this paper are (1) to focus on handling imperfection during the process of information retrieval and data integration (2) to create an evidential database by using the evidence theory in order to improve the efficiency of smart city. As experimentation we present a special case of modeling imperfect data in the field of Healthcare. An evidential database will be built which will contain all the perfect and imperfect data. These data come from several Heterogeneous sources in a context of Smart Cities. Imperfect aspects in the evidential database expressed by the theory of beliefs that will present in this paper.}

The framework is built on the basis of two recurring dimensions in research about people's concerns about privacy: one dimensions represents that people perceive particular data as more personal and sensitive than others, the other dimension represents that people's privacy concerns differ according to the purpose for which data is collected, with the contrast between service and surveillance purposes most paramount. These two dimensions produce a 2×2 framework that hypothesizes which technologies and data-applications in smart cities are likely to raise people's privacy concerns, distinguishing between raising hardly any concern (impersonal data, service purpose), to raising controversy (personal data, surveillance purpose). Specific examples from the city of Rotterdam are used to further explore and illustrate the academic and practical usefulness of the framework. It is argued that the general hypothesis of the framework offers clear directions for further empirical research and theory building about privacy concerns in smart cities, and that it provides a sensitizing instrument for local governments to identify the absence, presence, or emergence of privacy concerns among their citizens.}

However, the reality is that increasingly people are moving to cities, which generates many challenges for the cities of tomorrow. In this context, the Smart Cityconcept emerges, where Information and Communication Technologies have a key role. This situation has revealed an important issue that needs to be addressed: the lack of an ubiquitous communication architecture able to deal with the expected requirements of a SC. To this end, a wide review of the existing communication frameworks and city services have been performed, which showed that existing proposals are classical fixed ad-hocsolutions for very specific problems with no resilience and common thread. By rethinking the nature of cities and considering them as living organisms, it is possible to relate the nervous systems with the communication architecture of a city. Therefore, this work proposes a novel communication architecture, ubiquitous and resilient, inspired in the human nervous system by the definition of Smart Gateways, able to satisfy the needs of a real SCand adaptable to the growing and specific requirements of every single city. Additionally, the research also includes the simulation of the communication channel with different technologies.}

abstract = {Efficient and dynamic traffic management is an integral part of any smart city. Finding the shortest route considering congestion in real-time and managing traffic signals determine the efficiency of overall traffic flow. Route planning within a dynamic traffic environment remains an open challenge due to some essential unaddressed issues. Specially, considering priority vehicles to provide better traffic flow. For example, the routes of the vehicles need to be derived in such a way that higher priority vehicles like ambulances, police cars, etc. are provided efficient routes and green signals as per their given priority. To establish the solution we need to consider two factors. Vehicle rerouting to obtain shorter path and traffic signal optimization for lesser waiting time by a vehicle on a traffic signal. Existing works don't consider both factors in their work and tried to solve the issue reactively; upon request for clearance by a vehicle on a particular traffic signal. The proposed work seems to be a proactive approach that considers both factors. In this work, a dynamic real-time traffic environment with prioritized vehicles is modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. The solution ensures that the routes are offered to the vehicles in a way such that the unit travel time of a vehicle with higher priority must be less compared to vehicles with lesser priority. In addition, the traffic signal settings are optimized in a coordinated way to achieve the above-mentioned goal. Rigorous experimentation is done for validation of the proposed solution. Several traffic situations consisting of inherent dynamism are simulated through SUMO and the experimental findings substantiate our claims in terms of various traffic metrics.}

A relevant difference between developed and emerging economies is the reduced access to home charging in emerging economies, which is the case in Latin American cities. Thus, developing public charging stations represents a crucial factor in the mass adoption of EVs by road commuters. We develop herein a methodology for optimizing the deployment of smart charging stations under the sprawling phenomenon perspective. Our method comprises two steps. In step one, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to facilitate the analysis of a sprawling city, and then we define candidates for potential locations from ‘demand clusters’ within an urbanized area, by K-means clustering analysis. In the second step, a stochastic programming model was employed to optimize the integration of infrastructural facilities with distributed energy resources (DERs) and EV charging stations using a collaborative strategy to minimize its energy consumption cost under demand uncertainty. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through a case study in the city of Lima. Experimental results reveal managerial insights for different stakeholders (i.e., government, industry, academia, and civil society) to promote policies, investment, and incentives.}

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way. As the paper shows through alternative uses of Smart technologies and digital open-source fabrication, the question is not so much around technology per se but around the wider politico-economic context into which these technological assemblages are embedded.}

Choosing a path with minimal energy path cost does not guarantee in link stability and reliability of individual nodes in the network. A novel energy-efficient routing protocol named as Link Error Recovery Max-Min Path (LER-MMP) has been proposed. This protocol includes total energy spent on reliable transmission forl optimized paths in dynamic network. The link error rate that affects re-transmission with increased transmission error rate and therefore LER-MMP protocol selects an efficient path that has less number of long-distance hops for reliable network connectivity.

The estimation of the arrival of university transport bus is by measuring the RSSI to determinate the distance between nodes on a star topology using IEEE 802.15.4. The proposed method consists of de-encapsulating the received frame at the fixed node to obtain the RSSI and the travel time information sent by the mobile node through WDSN. The algorithm to detect the location of the node is based on the static calibration method of the normal logarithmic shadowing (LNSM) parameters. The measurement results show that the proposed method is useful to determinate the location between nodes in smart cities.}

These agents operate on behalf of users that need services; for these reason agents are often in competition with each other. On the other hand, an agent can often benefit from collaborating with other agents in some circumstances, exchanging information and services. Under this viewpoint, the task of finding the best partners to collaborate is a key task for an agent. A general consensus exists about the benefits deriving by forming friendships and groups for mutual cooperation inside competitive Multi-Agent Systems (MASs). In this respect, the existing proposals are usually addressed to maximize the profit at the level of individual agent or group. Unfortunately, the most part of these approaches could advantage the most aggressive agents, also in presence of bad social behaviors. This is not a desired scenario in a smart city environment. A possible solution to this problem is that of promoting correct behaviors and meritocracy inside agent communities. To this aim, we propose to model the competitive MAS scenario in the framework of non cooperative games by assuming to represent (i) the trustworthiness of agents relationships by means of a trust model and (ii) the capability of a community to provide its members with a good environment by means of its social capital. As a result, a group formation algorithm capable to asymptotically maximize the social capital is proposed. This algorithm highlights two main features: (i) the computed solution is a Nash equilibrium in the considered game and (ii) the only rewarded agents are those having the most correct behaviors.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel large scale data management model for future smart cities. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe by processing the collected data at the edge. To handle the large scale requirements in smart city, we introduce a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) framework in order to increase the reliability of the deployed applications. MEC is a promising framework to reduce the cloud core utilization as well as to provide applications that require low latency to mobile end users. As near as possible to the location of the end user, MEC relates to the mobile network applications and data stream acceleration through caching and/or compressing of relevant data at the edge of the mobile network. Although MEC is not yet deployed in real-life systems, recent studies discussed some technical details and related concepts. This paper studies the definition of MEC and similar concepts with respect to typical application scenarios, like in smart cities, and provides scope and limitations that may be encountered when implementing and deploying MEC. Then, a MEC framework is used to explore the data management infrastructure for upcoming smart cities.}

abstract = {Smart cities are racing to create a more connected Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that rely on collecting data from every possible sensor such as a smart utility meter or a smart parking meter. The use of more sensors resulted in generating a lot of information that maps the smart city environment conditions to more real time data points that needed to be shared and analyzed among smart city nodes. One possibility, to carry and share the collected data, is in autonomous vehicles systems, which use the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. For example, in a Car-to-Parking-Meter or a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, short-range embedded sensors such as Bluetooth, Cameras, Lidar send the collected data to the vehicle’s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or to a road side gateway for making collaborative decisions and react to the environment’s surrounding conditions. The goal of this research is to develop and test a DSRC based sensor-pooling protocol for vehicles to cooperatively communicate inclement weather or environment conditions. Five simulation experiments are setup using PreScan and Simulink to validate and study the scalability of the proposed solution. PreScan is an automotive simulation platform that is used for developing and testing Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). The research findings proved that the DSRC can be used to effectively stream the short range sensors’ collected data over a long distance communications link.}

The stability of these networks is based on stable and secure data transmission without any vulnerabilities present used devices. Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks have brought critical interruptions in IoT services and significantly damage the network. In DDoS attacks, attackers utilize botnets, with the capability of frequently exploiting the millions of IoT devices around the globe. After the source code of Mirai malware is loaded on GitHub, the threats are significantly increased. Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is an embedded software standard for IoT device makers to advertise device specifications, including the intended communication patterns when it connects to the network. Even though the MUD mechanism is promising exertion, still there is a need for evaluating its viability, recognize its limits, and upgrade its architecture to reduce shortcomings in its architecture as well as to increase its effectiveness. This standard neither identifies the vulnerability path before the creation of the MUD profile. Thus, it is possible to exploit an IoT device even after the MUD profile is issued to the device by manipulating the vulnerabilities in the device. By keeping in mind this situation, this paper discusses the limitations of MUD in detail and proposed a framework to identify the patch and default vulnerabilities by using blockchain method before the generation/creation of MUD profiles. The proposed framework can also mitigate open ports, DDoS attacks, and Brute force attacks. The experiment results show the identification, elimination, and sharing of vulnerability report with vendors and significantly minimized the risk of IoT device exploitation.}

This is due to the fact that they have been effective in significantly reducing the energy consumption of buildings. A typical BMS is composed of smart devices that communicate with one another in order to achieve their purpose. However, the heterogeneity of these devices and their associated meta-data impede the deployment of solutions that depend on the interactions among these devices. Nonetheless, automatically inferring the semantics of these devices using data-driven methods provides an ideal solution to the problems brought about by this heterogeneity. In this paper, we undertake a multi-dimensional study to address the problem of inferring the semantics of IoT devices using machine learning models. Using two datasets with over 67 million data points collected from IoT devices, we developed discriminative models that produced competitive results. Particularly, our study highlights the potential of Image Encoded Time Series (IETS) as a robust alternative to statistical feature-based inference methods. Leveraging just a fraction of the data required by feature-based methods, our evaluations show that this encoding competes with and even outperforms traditional methods in many cases.}

The landscape requirements and the solutions to local problems are the critical factors. The cities consume 75% of worldwide energy production and generate 80% of CO2 emissions. Thus, a sustainable urban model, “the smart city”, is sustained by the European Commission. In this paper, a model for computing “the smart city” indices is proposed. The chosen indicators are not homogeneous, and contain high amount of information. The paper deals with the computation of assigned weights for the considered indicators. The proposed approach uses a procedure based on fuzzy logic and defines a model that allows us to estimate “the smart city”, in order to access European funding. The proposed innovative system results in a more extended comprehension and simple use. Thus, the model could help in policy making process as starting point of discussion between stakeholders, as well as citizens in final decision of adoption measures and best evaluated options.}

Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.}

Recently, Xiong et al. designed an anonymous authentication scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for roaming in smart city. However, we show that their scheme lacks of two-factor security, and suffers from impersonation attack. To fix these problems, an improved roaming authentication protocol with two-factor security is proposed, which is security by using applied pi calculus based formal validation tool ProVerif, and it has high computational efficiency by comparison with some related schemes.}

The lightweight data block structure is an improvement over the traditional blockchain technology. The simulation results show that the proposed lightweight data consensus algorithm reduces the average hop count of data transmission, thereby reducing the probability of data being stolen.

In contrast, AVs equipped with various sensors, including but not limited to LiDAR, radar, camera, and stereovision, can break the above dilemma in one reliable, ubiquitous, and inexpensive way. However, the current research mainly regards AVs as a participant, controller, or server instead of as an observer. AVs can perform well as floating (or probe) sensors collecting instant, massive, and actual data, which can be utilized to continuously monitor transport infrastructure as well as traffic state during cruising. In this book chapter, we introduce the ubiquitous sensing framework with AVs, fully tapping its tremendous sensing potential to contribute to the smart city. First, levels of sensing capacities, perception, mapping, and localization of AVs are discussed in turn. Second, we summarize and present how AVs play an essential role in various smart city scenarios, specifically in traffic state estimation, on-street parking management, signage identification, pavement maintenance, and pedestrian and safety/health monitoring. Third, both advantages and disadvantages of AVs are unfolded from the perspective of dialectical thinking. Lastly, this chapter ends with some conclusions. Overall, this chapter would help policymakers and private sectors (e.g., Waymo and other AV firms) pay more attention to the ubiquitous sensing capacities of AVs and deeply understand the latent commercial value in empowering smart cities.}

However, the increasing use of the CPS and their application to key infrastructure components means that failures can result in disruption, damage and even loss of life. Avoiding these consequences is not a trivial problem and some researchers propose that cloud computing can provide the effective and sustainable services for smart city. With the integration of CPS and cloud computing, sensor-cloud system becomes popular in many fields where the physical nodes can be shared with multiple users, which can achieve high performance computing. However, when a physical sensor node receives multiple services commands simultaneously, there will be some service collisions, namely, coupling resource management problem. This coupling resource management problem leads to the failures of services. In order to solve the coupling resource management problem, we propose a fog computing model and extend the Hungarian algorithm to manage the coupling resource which can get smaller delay to realize effective and sustainable services. The fog computing layer acts as a buffer and controller between CPS layer and cloud layer which can handle malicious attacks to build highly sustainable systems. Experimental results and theoretical analysis show that our method can reduce the coupling computing and increase the resource utilization to make systems more effectively.}

This control system actuates when an emergency happens and modifies dynamically the routes of normal and emergency urban traffic in order to reduce the time that the emergency resources need to get to the emergency area. The architecture is based on a set of IoT networks composed by traffic lights, traffic cameras and an algorithm. The algorithm controls the request of resources and the modification of routes in order to ease the movement of emergency service units. Afterwards, the proposal is tested by emulating a Smart City as a SDN-utilizing Mininet. The experiments show that the delay of the emergency traffic improves in a 33% when the algorithm is running. Moreover, the energy consumed by the IoT nodes is modeled and the obtained results display that it increases linearly with the number of nodes, therefore, the proposal is scalable.}

Hydrogen is a source for the production of energy by using any energy resource. In this chapter, we investigate the latest fuel production technologies providing energy outputs from renewable energy resources for their usage in smart cities. We study the role of renewable resources under the current dynamics of the global energy market situation as well as the effects of fuel production technologies to increase the efficiency and sustainability for the future of smart cities. This review includes a broad spectrum that spans from the technical energy resources literature with very comprehensive research by using SCOPUS database to nontechnical but renowned resources including journals and other publications including raw data as well as forecasts and opinions that respected experts have performed. Specifically, solar and wind production technologies, as well as future forecasts compared with the conventional fuel resources, are reviewed comprehensively. By that, we aim to shed a light on the current status of fuel production technologies in renewable energy resources and their usage in smart cities.}

Accordingly, transition towards a fossil fuel free future is not to be understood as a matter of techno-economic innovation but as a process in which the ‘social’ and the ‘technical’ are inextricably intertwined, and technologies co-evolve with programmes of governing. Research findings from a recent bibliometric study reveal a very different picture where city dwellers are rarely the subject of research into future energy plans for transition towards a fossil future free future. Instead the research publications tend to concentrate on technological innovation for energy production and consumption. The findings are a concern given that the transition towards a fossil fuel free future will have a greater likelihood of success with public engagement and public acceptance. The paper explores the current transformation of sociotechnical imaginaries towards a more participatory idea of smart cities that emerge from real-world practices; and the resistances and resiliencies to this transformation in research domain.

Future smart cities will be characterized by their high distribution, openness, heterogeneity, complexity, unpredictable/uncertain/dynamic work environments, and their large-scale nature. These challenging characteristics require a transition from the traditional parts thinking paradigm which studies systems by breaking them down into their separate elements to the emerging systems thinking paradigm which represents a holistic approach focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems. In this article, we first study smart cities from systems thinking perspective and then introduce self-regulating agent systems and fog computing as promising technological paradigms for developing future large-scale complex smart cities applications. Preliminary simulation results to test the performance of the proposed framework are provided. The results show that self-regulated agent systems can give high performance if an appropriate self-regulation model is used. A complete architecture for building future complex smart cities based on the systems thinking paradigm and using self-regulating MAS integrated with fog computing for implementation is currently under preparation.}

Accordingly, we need a quantum tool utilised for designing blockchain frameworks to have the ability to be executed in the level of digital computers and resist the probable attacks from both digital and quantum computers. Quantum walks may be utilised as a quantum-inspired model for designing new cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we present a new authentication and encryption protocol based on quantum-inspired quantum walks (QIQW). The proposed protocol is utilized to build a blockchain framework for secure data transmission among IoT devices. Instead of using classical cryptographic hash functions, quantum hash functions based on QIQW are employed for linking blocks of the chain. The main advantages of the presented framework are helping IoT nodes to effectively share their data with other nodes and full control of their records. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed protocol can defend against message attack and impersonation attacks, thus ensuring secure transmission of data among IoT devices.}

In IoT and wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the nodes are generally grouped as clusters, which lead to forming Cluster Head (CH) that collects data from all other nodes and explicitly communicates with Base Station. In this paper, numerous objectives like delay minimization, energy sustainability could be accomplished through implementing a clustering algorithm on the intra-distance inter-distance between the CH and nodes. The optimization variables such as distance, delay, and energy used in IoT devices are taken into account to achieve the desired CH selection. In order to develop an enhanced IoT-Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) model, this paper introduces an advanced approach for CH selection using a modified Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA). In the proposed algorithm, the solutions are sorted into two sets based on the best fitness value. The first set is updated using the averaged value of bypass and follower riders while the second set is updated through the averaged value of attacker and overtaker riders, which is called as Fitness Averaged-ROA (FA-ROA). The performance of the proposed FA-ROA is verified through a comparative analysis using various state-of-the-arts optimization models by concerning the number of alive nodes and normalized energy.}

To overcome this challenge, the cognitive radio network (CRN) has widely been accepted for efficient utilization of the available spectrum. Hence, efficient spectrum utilization and secured communication have attracted significant attention in recent years. However, due to the involvement of smart wireless devices in CRN, the cognitive radio (CR) systems are vulnerable to security threats that mainly target the weaknesses of CR communication and networking. Considering the efficient utilization of spectrum and secured smart city applications, this paper proposes a Secured and Reliable Cognitive Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (SRC-HARQ) scheme. The SRC-HARQ models the primary user (PU) channel by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify the unoccupied spaces. Based on the HMM results, the cluster head (CH) in a smart city determines the activity pattern of PUs and detects idle channels. After the detection of an idle channel, the CH broadcasts a beacon. Upon the reception of a beacon, each member node responds with a ready-to-send (RTS) message along with an encrypted message. The CH replies with a clear-to-send (CTS) signal after the successful decryption of the received message. Furthermore, a 4-state Markov Chain is used for reliability in terms of false alarm and misdetection. The closed-form expressions for mean packet delay, end-to-end delay, and throughput are derived and validated using Monte Carlo simulations.}

Above all, this study suggests that privacy-preserving policies and practices to share disease and health information of patients having the same disease should consider detailed disease information to enhance data utility.

And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one’s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.}

This article focuses on smart city projects that received European funding, and explores why, how and with what effect for citizen participation these projects are shaped by specific visions for European cities in general, and for European smart cities in particular. It does so by situating these ideas within the intersecting political-economic ambitions of those able to grant ‘smart’ (European Research and Innovation Schemes) and those needing to pursue it (post-crisis municipalities). It then illustrates how this political economy results in a discursive production logic that explains why so many smart city projects, that were or want to be successful in European grant applications, tend to exclude the perspective and interests of citizens. The article consequently proposes that politicians, city makers and scientists, who so laudably (cl)aim to position and treat citizens as key stakeholders in European smart cities, reflect more explicitly on their own roles in preserving and challenging this production logic.}

abstract = {This study addresses the strategic governance challenges of modern smart cities from the new viewpoint of big data management. It seeks to develop and highlight a systematic methodological framework for handling multivariate big data in a smart urban decision support context in the ‘New Urban World’, so as to enhance the cities’ competitive performance through the design and development of operational urban management principles and strategies. The specific aim of this paper is to provide the critical and basic cornerstones for an applicable interactive dashboard architecture as a supporting tool in a structured process of innovative city strategies and consequent enhanced socio-economic performance. A core element in the present paper is formed by a smart urban dashboard system that acts as an interactive navigation tool supporting operational choices of all stakeholders involved. This dashboard is able to integrate complex and ever-changing big data bases serving as ‘signposts’ of city intelligence (or i-city smartness) for daily or strategic decisions of all urban stakeholders. This study thus outlines successively the concept of smart i-cities in our ‘urban century’, the great potential of digital technology for managing big data in governing i-cities, and the foundations of an urban dashboard on the basis of the so-called Pentagon model as a policy strategy vehicle. Starting from extensive data on a broad set of global cities, the potential of this approach is exemplified by means of an illustrative application of a smart urban dashboard for the city of Stockholm.}

There are variety of definitions for smart city in different fields and regions. Generally, it aims for a sustainable city development through the optimal management of the resources and potential, offering a comprehensively higher quality life to the citizens. The planning of area energy system is one of the most important issues, which is related to the energy generation, the energy consumption by facilities, transportation system, and any other city infrastructures. Especially for Japan, one of the countries facing the complex issues of an aging society, disaster management and energy dependency need a new methodologies for optimal urban energy planning that integrates all information from these sectors. Smart city with highly developed information and communications technology (ICT) is considered as such an important approach. To encourage the smart city concept in Japan, this paper proposes a “GIS-BIM” based urban energy planning system to access the optimal technical and policy solution for readjust city infrastructure beyond the integrated analysis. Firstly, it introduces the concept of Japanese smart city which covers from urban planning to infrastructure. Secondly, the research proposes a GIS-BIM based urban energy planning system including the database construction and analysis by GIS, the optimal energy system design aided by BIM and 3D visualization with user-friendly interface. Finally, center of Tokyo is adopted as a case study, suggesting the potential to access the optimal technical and policy solution.}

In line with this key insight, in this paper we have designed and implemented a decentralized, trustless DLT-based system for (environmental) sensing, data acquisition, storage, and consumption, in the context of a real-world Smart City deployment, #SmartME, and with the participation of independent, institutional, stakeholders. This Open Data system has been devised to be user-friendly, with an end-user wizard for trustless (i.e., independent) data audit. Indeed, the data collection layer does not trust any IoT node by default, but requires nodes to authenticate themselves when sending readings. Last but not least, the storage layer is again trustless, as institutions can pool together their resources, without trusting one another, nor entrusting the administration of the system to any third party. In this work we extend our preliminary proof-of-concept design, and explore the expected outcomes of scaling the system to comprise an even greater number of active institutions participating in the validation process, by carrying out simulation experiments. Results from these experiments help us in validating our approach and assessing its scalability.}

This editorial introduction to this special issue provides an overview and a conceptual framework of governance and economics of smart cities. We begin with a discussion of the background to smart cities and then it focuses on the key challenges for consideration in smart city economics. Here it is argued that there are four dimensions to smart city economics: the first is regarding the scale of global market for smart cities; the second issue concerns data to be used for smart city projects; the third concerns market competition and structure and the fourth concerns the impact on local economy. Likewise, smart city governance framework has to be considered a layered and multi-level concept focusing on issues of transparency and accountability to the citizens.}

The expectation that smart cities may promote the adoption of scalable solutions that take advantage of information and communication technologies (ICT) to increase their effectiveness, reduce costs and to improve the quality of life is great among academia, business and governmental stakeholders. Traffic management systems in its multiple applications (including re-routing) are an example of ICT solutions that can expectably lead to the purpose pursued by 'smart cities'. This paper develops a performance evaluation of re-routing for passenger and commercial vehicles with a case study in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. The paper examines how the provision of guidance information to drivers affects traffic performance, operational costs and environmental conditions at different spatial references, namely route level and urban network level. The simulation results indicate that the re-routing can not only reduce travel times, but also enhance the efficiency of roads in the city network and as well the traffic performance at the route level of analysis. The improvement at local route levels (such as corridor/route) is more significant than at the city network level. For the urban network level, simulation results suggest that re-routing can bring variations in travel and delays that may reach 2% and 6%, respectively, when a 10% drivers’ compliance rate is considered. Individual drivers are more likely to comply to deviate than urban logistics drivers and bus drivers.}

By deploying internet of things (IoT) to infrastructure systems, high-volume and high-variety of data pertinent to the condition and performance of infrastructure systems along with the behaviors of citizens can be gathered, processed, integrated and analyzed through cloud-based infrastructure asset management systems, ubiquitous mobile applications and big data analytics platforms. Nonetheless, how to fully exploit the value of ‘big infrastructure data’ is still a key challenge facing most stakeholders. Unless data is shared by different infrastructure systems in an interoperable and consistent manner, it is difficult to realize the smart infrastructure concept for efficient smart city planning, not to mention about developing appropriate resilience and sustainable programs. To unlock the value of big infrastructure data for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, a master data management (MDM) solution is proposed in this paper. MDM has been adopted in the business sector to orchestrate operational and analytical big data applications. In order to derive a suitable MDM solution for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, commercial and open source MDM systems, smart city standards, smart city concept models, smart community infrastructure frameworks, semantic web technologies will be critically reviewed, and feedback and requirements will be gathered from experts who are responsible for developing smart, sustainable and resilient city programs. A case study which focuses on the building and transportation infrastructures of a selected community in Hong Kong will be conducted to pilot the proposed MDM solution.}

The popular ‘smart city paradigm is characterized by ubiquitous cyber provisions for the monitoring and control of such city's critical infrastructures, encompassing healthcare, environment, transportation and utilities among others. In order to manage the numerous services keeping their Quality of Service (QoS) demands upright, it is imperative to employ context aware computing as well as fog computing simultaneously. This paper investigates the feasibility of energy minimization at the fog layer through intelligent sleep and wake-up cycles of the fog nodes which are context-aware. It proposes a virtual machine management approach for effectively allocating service requests with a minimal number of active fog nodes using a genetic algorithm (GA); and thereafter, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is incorporated to optimize the period of fog nodes’ duty cycle. Simulations are carried out using MATLAB and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves energy consumption of the fog layer by approximately 11–21% when compared to existing context sharing based algorithms.}

IoT combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied to many day to day applications in superior systems like transportation, robotics, industrial, and automation systems applications. This research focuses on developing a robotic behavior control using the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) using deep learning for a Smart City. The IoRT is a promising standard that brings together autonomous robotic systems in the midst of the IoT vision of connected sensors and smart objects pervasively embedded in the day to day environments. Robotic behavioral control models the robot with the essential features to react with the immediate environment via sensory-motor links. Robotic behavioral control has a direct interconnection between the sensors and actuators and controls the functions necessary to move around the environment and carry out necessary tasks. This deep learning solution applied to the robotic behavioral control for robotic application uses two main paradigms: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Imitation Learning (IL).DRL merges the concept of deep learning architecture using neural networks and Reinforcement learning algorithms to identify the behavior of the robots.IL focus on imitating human learning or expert demonstration for controlling the robot behavior. The behavior of the robot is monitored in a diner and its performance is estimated to be 92% in realtime}

This vision has been further expanded in the Internet of Things (IoT) era to embrace multipurpose resources within a smart city setup such as public sensors on roads/vehicles, cameras, RFID tags, and readers. The realization of such a prophecy is significantly challenged in terms of connectivity disruption, resource management, and data gathering under mobile conditions. In this paper, we present a hybrid pervasive sensing framework for data gathering in IoT-enabled smart-cities’ paradigm. This framework satisfies service-oriented applications in smart cities where data is provided via data access points (APs) of various resources. Moreover, public vehicles are used in this work as Data Couriers (DCs) that read these APs data packets and relay it back to a base-station in the city. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid fitness function for a genetic-based DCs selection approach. Our function considers resource limitations in terms of count, storage capacity and energy consumption as well as the targeted application characteristics. Extensive simulations are performed and the effectiveness of the proposed approach has been confirmed against other heuristic approaches with respect to total travelled distances and overall data-delivery cost.}

Instead, it is intended to extract only the data necessary to optimize the operations of the organization.

The user interface and standard operating procedure and the resource processing capabilities of the IOC indicate that this system is optimal for smart cities of the future with regard to improvement of quality of life and ease of navigation.

A smart city uses many sensors and actuators, and it is relying completely on the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). To maintain sustainability and real-time deployment of smart cities the necessary factors required are secured wireless connectivity and IoT. Being smarter also makes the city more vulnerable to cyber attacks.

Numerous edge-enabled mechanisms have been presented in literature to resolve these issues, but device-to-device authentication (preferably in multi-hop enabled networking) to resolve the black-hole issue is not addressed yet. In this paper, a mutual authentication scheme, a hybrid of Medium Access Control (MAC) address and EAODV-enabled scheme, for establishing secure device-to-device communication sessions in IoT networks is presented to make edge-enabled smart cities safe and secure. Every device Ci is bounded to register its Mac address with the concerned base station or edge module Sj in an off-line phase to prevent entry of the intruder device(s) in the operational edge-enabled IoT network. Moreover, the initiation of a proper communication session with both device Ci and edge or base station Sj is subjected to the authentication process. Only those devices Ci are allowed to initiate a communication session which are already registered in the off-line phase where entry of the intruder node(s) at any stage is not possible. Apart from it, a well-known encryption and decryption mechanism is used to guarantee a secure communication session. Simulation results have verified that the proposed mutual authentication scheme performance is better than existing schemes specifically in terms of processing and communication overheads.}

New systems try to improve the experiences citizens in Smart Cities platforms, because many of these government platforms are not user-friendly and their quality, in terms of UX, are not up to the task. To solve this problem, both in the interface design and UX, the solution proposed in this article is the application of Adaptive Interface Ecosystems (AIE), a new concept that can be applied to existing interfaces. The advantage of using AIE on developed and in operation interfaces is that it is not necessary to redesign the interface, but rather they will be adjusted (adapting over time) to each user’s own way of using and monitoring it. The AIEs give the possibility of perfecting the initial modeling of an interface, collecting and analyzing the segmented data of citizens’ interactions. The proposed model has been evaluated by expert users in a real scenario and compared with other existing software with similar features.}

abstract = {Perishable export products are usually shipped to their international destinations by air. This export process is complex and involves many agents such as airlines, truck companies and manufacturers. Two of the major problems that transport companies face every day are (1) traffic and (2) congestion of trucks at the unloading platforms at the airports. In general, the lack of coordination between such agents amplify these problems. We introduce a simulation- optimization approach for the coordination of truck companies that deliver export flowers to international destinations in the context of smart cities. The proposed method was tested with real-time traffic and status of the airport cargo areas and show drastic improvements in comparison with the current situation. The proposed method can be embedded in smartphone applications and can use existing technologies and can be adapted to current practices.}

India as a developing country has a great prospect in developing technologies to make the cities smart. As urbanization occurs the demand for resources and efficient servicing will increase. To achieve this in a smart and efficient way, connected device (IoT) could be used. The possible design of an IoT system based on surveys performed on similar smart solutions implemented has been discussed in this paper. Urbanization and population growth has led to higher demand for resources like water which are of scarce. There is a keen interest from the organizations and government to make proper usage of water. The same can be achieved by proper monitoring and management of water distribution systems. The paper discusses the use of Machine learning techniques to smart city management aspects like smart water management which include water demand forecasting, water quality monitoring and anomaly detection.}

Smart City refer to the city that integrates modern technologies for automated and efficient service providing to enhance citizens’ lifestyle. Latest studies show that like 60 present of the whole world's population will be living in urban environments by the year 2030. This massively growing population in urban environments leads to the need of advanced management approaches that use latest IT platforms and techniques for smartening every city-related service. Such emergent integration of technologies faces several security- related challenges because of not considering security tests of new deployed technologies, in addition to not engaging other system parties with security incidents due to the huge communication. On the other side, high complexity, high interdependency and intensive communication lead to unbounded attack surface and cryptography-related issues. In our paper, we intend to provide detailed overview based on literature of smart cities’ major security problems and current solutions. Moreover, we present several influencing factors that affect data and information security in smart cities.}

However, on one hand the background operations inevitably press a negative impact on the latency of normal requests to the services, while on the other hand to maintain the short latency of requests usually results in unreasonably long latency of background operations. In this paper, on the architecture of IoT-enabled Smart City services deployed in clouds, our motivation is to find the best management policy of operations for normal request traffic, which is stable and stationary and to which operations are inserted. We focus on the system environment in which administrators are dealing with in most time other than discuss the special cases, such as outages or rush hours, and take the assumptions e.g. predictability and periodicity. The suitable management techniques for us are a class of online management policies, which are simple and applicable in practice. These policies harmonise the requests and the operations by giving higher priority to the normal requests other than forcing the background operations to wait unreasonably. We also propose a statistical policy, which is asymptotically optimal in the class. In order to compute the numeric solution, we employ a queueing model to analyse our policy. The evaluation indicates that our technique can effectively maintain the short latency of the requests, and meanwhile the latency of operations is not unreasonably long in comparison to the competitors.}

One of such modern technology that has gained popularity on recent years is blockchain technology, which can be adapted into the green smart cities. Blockchain is a distributed ledger on a decentralized network, it plays a major role in handling large volume of data, highly tamper resistant against various attacks, immutable, simplify verification and auditing requirements, highly cost-efficient, and provides security to the sensitive data. Also the traditional cyber-security protection to the smart devices is not enough due to its dynamic, heterogeneity, and scalability characteristics. Thus, blockchain can be used as a solution to handle various challenges in the green smart city development. In this chapter, current overview of green smart cities is studied to find the challenges in the green smart city and how various blockchain-based applications could solve the issues in a green smart city are discussed, creating a way to analyze the better usage of blockchain in the research and development of future green smart cities.}

This type of vehicles might use ultra-reliable telecommunication systems, Internet-based technologies, and navigation satellite services to decide about the routes they must follow to efficiently accomplish their mission and reach their destinations in due time. When working in teams of vehicles, there is a need to coordinate their routing operations. When some unexpected events occur in the city (e.g., after a traffic accident, a natural disaster, or a terrorist attack), coordination among vehicles might need to be done in real-time. Using the team orienteering problem as an illustrative case scenario, this paper analyzes how the combined use of extremely fast biased-randomized heuristics and parallel computing allows for ‘agile’ optimization of routing plans for drones and other autonomous vehicles.}

This research proposes a theoretical model and present privacy and security as key drivers of citizens’ intentions to continue using smartcards. The functional benefits (i.e. usefulness and ease-of-use), the level of personal interaction with local services, and the direct and moderating effects of socio-demographic variables complete our framework. The findings of an empirical study with smartcard users in Zaragoza (Spain) show usefulness and security as the main antecedents of continuance intentions. In turn, the influence of socio-demographic variables is not significant, which suggests that smartcards should focus on a wide-range of users. These results offer interesting implications and recommendations for public managers such as the need to guarantee the security of the transaction system and to expand the number of services and initiatives relaying on the smartcard service in order to gradually develop the smart city transformation.}

The existing studies have started addressing waste management problems in smart cities mainly by focusing on the design of new sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and optimizing the routes for waste collection trucks with the aim of minimizing operational costs, energy consumption and transportation pollution emissions. In this study, the importance of value recovery from trash bins is highlighted. A stochastic optimization model based on chance-constrained programming is developed to optimize the planning of waste collection operations. The objective of the proposed optimization model is to minimize the total transportation cost while maximizing the recovery of value still embedded in waste bins. The value of collected waste is modeled as an uncertain parameter to reflect the uncertain value that can be recovered from each trash bin due to the uncertain condition and quality of waste. The application of the proposed model is shown by using a numerical example. The study opens new venues for incorporating the value recovery aspect into waste collection planning and development of new data acquisition technologies that enable municipalities to monitor the mix of recyclables embedded in individual trash bins.}

Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate–informative–transformative), purpose of service (hedonic–utilitarian), service authority (voluntary–mandatory), and delivery mode (passive–interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework. Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens.}

Whether to use single-echelon or two-echelon systems with micro-depots and city freighters as well as quantifying the benefits of shipment consolidation between independent providers under different system designs are unanswered questions in academia and practice. We provide a general methodological framework based on continuous approximation theory to study the design of city logistics networks with multiple logistics service providers that choose transportation strategies, each defined by a network structure and specific transportation modes. We provide analytical results on the comparison of different transportation strategies. By providing thresholds on the benefit of consolidated systems, we analytically quantify shipment consolidation effects in city centers. We then embed this continuous approximation into a mixed-integer non-linear program and study parameter sensitivities for a real-world case study. Our results show that higher customer density and longer distances between depots and distribution areas promote 2-tier transportation strategies. Consolidation between logistics service providers allows for emission reductions independent of the transportation strategy and correlate with cost reductions up to 50% on the lower echelon. Outsourcing promotes 2-tier last-mile deliveries with city freighters and in a city with heterogeneous districts, it is beneficial to use a hybrid network that includes both single- and two-echelon strategies using multiple transportation modes for different demand classes.}
