abstract = {Transportation is undergoing an electric revolution and the marine sector is missing many of the advances made in other industries. The critical roadblock is the virtual actor of safety. To date, there is no viable replacement for the range, comfort, and safety provided by a tank of diesel. The question this research asks is could fully integrating transport, storage, and eliminating critical excess energy within the closed loop of the sailing vessel increase comfort, safety, range, and speed? This paper leverages the smart energy systems approach and is based on existing technology, including the propeller. However, it applies a new approach to driveline design and operation as a basis to model energy performance. In our model, wind is the primary energy source converted into electric energy via hydro-generation; the point of departure from existing systems is the ability to fully manage critical excess energy in an integrated smart energy system. Energy management is carried out by a new performance algorithm called Charge Made Good (CMG), that allows the vessel to predict the battery state at the journey’s end and maintain this prediction during periods of intermittent energy production from forecast variance. The model shows that fossil fuels used for safety and range in direct-drive and electric-hybrid systems can be eliminated, with an improved level of amenity aboard and an improved safety factor using the smart energy systems approach. It is the first academic research to address the safety and comfort of zero-emissions recreational craft rather than technical but unusable/uneconomic solutions.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected people’s behavioral patterns and schedules because of stay-at-home orders and a reduction of social interactions. Therefore, the shape of electrical loads associated with residential buildings has also changed. In this paper, we quantify the changes and perform a detailed analysis on how the load shapes have changed, and we make potential recommendations for utilities to handle peak load and demand response. Our analysis incorporates data from before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from an Alabama Power Smart Neighborhood with energy-efficient/smart devices, using around 40 advanced metering infrastructure data points. This paper highlights the energy usage pattern changes between weekdays and weekends pre– and post–COVID-19 pandemic times. The weekend usage patterns look similar pre– and post–COVID-19 pandemic, but weekday patterns show significant changes. We also compare energy use of the Smart Neighborhood with a traditional neighborhood to better understand how energy-efficient/smart devices can provide energy savings, especially because of increased work-from-home situations. HVAC and water heating remain the largest consumers of electricity in residential homes, and our findings indicate an even further increase in energy use by these systems.}

Smart homes have become prominent in recent technology and policy discussions about energy efficiency, climate change, and the sustainability of buildings. Nevertheless, how might culture shape the diffusion and use of the technologies used in smart homes? What cultural barriers may impede their adoption, or embed more carbon-intensive lifestyles? Lastly, do smart home technologies truly promote sustainability goals? Based on an extensive original dataset involving expert interviews in four countries—Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and original media content analysis, this study explores the cultural aspects of smart home technology adoption as well as the consequent impacts on sustainability. In doing so, the study elaborates on an array of social, technical, political, economic and environmental dimensions of smart home technology diffusion, with clear implications for research, policy, and technology development. In this sense, we call for more comprehensive, progressive, innovative and sensitive technology design so as to advance SHT adoption and fulfill some of the sustainability and climate objectives their advocates continually promise.}

abstract = {IoT based smart agriculture systems are important for efficient usage of lands, water, and energy resources. Wireless communication protocols constitute a critical part of smart agriculture systems because the fields, in general, cover a large area requiring system components to be placed at distant locations. There are various communication protocols with different features that can be utilized in smart agriculture applications. When designing a smart agriculture system, it is required to carefully consider the features of possible protocols to make a suitable and optimal selection. Therefore, this review paper aims to underline the specifications of the wireless communication protocols that are widely used in smart agriculture applications. Furthermore, application-specific requirements, which may be useful during the design stage of the smart agriculture systems, are highlighted. To accomplish these aims, this paper compares the technical properties and investigates the practical applications of five different wireless communication protocols that are commonly used in IoT applications: ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN. In particular, the inconsistencies in the technical properties of these protocols reported in different resources have been highlighted and the reason for this situation has been discussed. Considering the features offered by the protocols and the requirements of smart agriculture applications, the appropriateness of a particular protocol to a particular smart agriculture application is examined. In addition, issues about cost, communication quality, and hardware of the five protocols have been mentioned. The trending technologies with high potential for the future applications of smart agriculture have been introduced. In this context, the relation of the technologies like aerial systems, cellular communication, and big data analytics with wireless have been specified. Finally, the leading protocol and the smart agriculture application area have been highlighted through observing the year-based distribution of the recent publications. It has been shown that usage of LoRaWAN protocol has become more widespread in recent years.}

However, traditional fully passive thermochromic smart windows cannot adjust their transparency according to the complex outdoor climate “intelligently”, and only adjusts the solar radiation, ignoring the indoor temperature increase caused by heat entering the room in the form of convection. Here, we embed poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) microgel into a highly transparent polyacrylamide (PAM) matrix, the PNIPAm-PAM hydrogel exhibits an ultrahigh luminous transmittance of 90.6% and solar modulation of 65.5%. By introducing nanoparticles into thermochromic hydrogels and combining the advantages of fluid glass in heat convection control, we develop a new type of active and passive dual-control smart window (APDC smart window) for the first time. In the indoor demonstration, it is proved that the smart window injected with 1-cm PNIPAm liquid has the best energy-saving ability, and the greenhouse installed with a 1-cm PNIPAm liquid smart window reduces the indoor air temperature by 15 °C compared with normal glass. In the outdoor demonstration, the indoor air temperatures of the APDC smart windows are reduced by ∼14 °C, ∼16 °C, ∼8.5 °C, and ∼9.5 °C respectively in different orientations of east, west, south, and north than normal glass window, and it is reduced by ∼4–8 °C compare with the 1-cm PNIPAm liquid smart window. This opens a new avenue for energy-efficient buildings and greenhouses.}

The attempts to solve the problem of mobility by using personal transport lead to the growth of automobilization. It is reflected adversely on the security of transport systems of cities. One of the ways to solve this problem is a part of the concept of a Smart City. Smart Mobility is one of the main directions of development of its transport system. At that, together with intellectualization of control one more question is being solved: transfer to more secure, stable and pure types of transport, such as bicycles. Its democratic nature and availability, cheapness and environmental friendliness, and the fact that it promotes the healthy way of life are the reasons of popularity of this transport. At the same time bicyclers, as well as pedestrians, are the least protected category of road users. Measures to ensure the safety of road traffic are usually aimed either at prevention of accidents or, if it’s impossible, at the reduction of severity of consequences. From our point of view the most important thing is developing measures for prevention of road accidents. Organizational and management solutions are often very effective at little cost. Thus, one of such methods is choosing safe routes. At the present time there are multiple navigational systems and route planners. Cartographic information is used in these systems and that helps to construct possible variants of routes between points A and B. However these routes are not assessed from the point of view of their security. At the same time there is statistics of road accidents which gives us the opportunity to find the most dangerous sections of road network. One of the possible system alternatives of assessment of the route security for different types of road traffic participants is described in the article. The developed system is based on multifactorial information analysis. Characteristics of different sections of road network as well as data on road traffic accidents are used for evaluating the levels of security of road sections. Correction factors enable taking into account the peculiarities of each type of road users. The developed algorithm is implemented as a computer application.}

LL utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions and apps aimed at ‘solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring digital competences and increasing citizens' participation in the SC, we argue LL foster largely a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for ‘smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are rooted often in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a technocratic version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LLs are used actively to bolster the Smart City discourse, as part of the more general neoliberalization of urban political economy. We discuss these approaches and issues generally, drawing on previous fieldwork and with respect to a case study of Dublin, Ireland.}

abstract = {Increasing the share of Electric Vehicles (EVs) powered by renewable-based Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) is a key step towards climate neutrality. However, increasing the penetration of EVs and Photovoltaic (PV) generators may create large and hardly predictable fluctuations in power supply and demand, thus destabilising the grid. In this paper, an optimisation algorithm for smart EV charging is proposed to reduce the overall net-load variance through a more efficient exploitation of the available PV power, EV charging shifting, or vehicle-to-grid (V2G). Key distinctive features of the proposed approach are: (i) the formulation as a quadratic programming problem; (ii) the capability to enable a V2G charging policy, (iii) the inclusion of specific constraints regarding EVs’ availability, owners’ charging requirements and, partially, voltage stability; (iii) the study of the combined impact of EV and PV penetration on bus voltages, line currents, district self-sufficiency, and EV battery lifetime. The proposed approach is tested not only in ideal conditions, but also considering a basic persistence forecasting model of load and PV generation over subsequent days. The results of grid-level simulations in a case study show that the proposed approach could decrease the net-load variance by up to 60% if no forecasting errors occur and by about 50% when the persistence forecasting model is used. Additionally, the V2G policy notably decreases both the range of voltage fluctuations and the risk of line overloading, although at the expense of EVs’ battery lifetime, whose reduction actually depends on the battery capacity.}

First, the design and verification of a single fog cooling unit was identified through an indoor experiment. Second, the temperature reduction effect of the installed fog cooling system was measured based on a sensor and verified through a finite volume method (FVM)-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Third, a numerical analysis of the optimal fog cooling arrangement was designed and performed in the Indongchon area. The temperature reduction design manual and model equations, which can be used by decision-makers, were analyzed through numerical analysis. The measured temperature reduction and simulation values had a high accuracy of R2 ≥ 0.8. Based on the verified model, scenarios A–D were designed and analyzed according to the fog cooling arrangement. Scenario B, in which the fog cooling was arranged vertically to the wind direction, appeared to be the most efficient. In this case, the volume average temperature where fog cooling was installed could be reduced by up to 3.02 °C. It was also found that efficiency is higher when the fog cooling system is positioned at narrow intervals of ≤5 m than at wide intervals of ≥10 m, considering the wind direction. The results of this study can aid decision makers—including urban policymakers and planners—for estimating the potential extent of temperature reduction and increase in humidity by adopting fog cooling.}

This study attempts to address this gap by systematically evaluating 1979 relevant journal and conference articles from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus, and those articles with a weak connection to the topic and poor data integrity were excluded. Finally, 1330 articles were chosen to for analysis in terms of contributions, critical papers, co-occurrence, and clustering using scientometric techniques. It was revealed that, with the help of advancing technologies, the research field of NUI aims to enrich the variety of interactive device types, improve the accuracy of interpreting and responding to user behavior, and optimize the compatibility with diverse user demographics. Besides, a conceptual framework summarizing typical types of NUI for the SHS was proposed, and strengths and weaknesses of each NUI were discussed for investigating specific future directions. Furthermore, four general research directions (strategies for promoting effective multimodal NUI, adoption of artificial intelligence for better performance, exploration of mixed reality applications in the SHS, and standardization of protocols in the smart home ecosystem) were also identified for academics and practitioners in their future research and practice.}

abstract = {A smart energy meter is one of the most significant smart grid products. The smart energy meter (SEM) is an advanced energy meter that collects data from end users' load devices, monitors energy usage, and then sends the data to the smart grid. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is used by smart energy meters to send real-time consumption data to utilities and customers. It is made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT), which expands the internet's capabilities to enable machine-to-machine or machine-to-server communication. Smart meters can communicate with each other using a variety of communication technologies. This paper presents a survey on communication technologies to determine the suitable technology based on a few parameters like cost-effectiveness, security, long-range, low power consumption, and data rate that are pre-requisite for smart meter communication. Firstly, a short literature survey is conducted to investigate the previous researches and challenges associated with communication technologies. The findings and future work of these articles are then summarized in a separate table for a clear understanding for the readers. Following that, an overview of communication technologies and their pros and cons are presented to understand critical aspects of each technology. A bibliometric analysis is also done to find the top countries, universities, and authors with greater incidence in this subject area worldwide by extracting citation data from Scopus and Web of Science. Besides, a comparison of major communication technologies is made in the discussion. Additionally, based on the parameters and literature reviewed, this paper suggests some suitable communication technologies for smart meters. It presents a model of a cost-effective hybrid communication system for smart metering and AMI. Finally, the possible issues and challenges related to communication technologies are discussed. Based on the challenges, several future research directions are also provided, which may lead to promising findings in the near future.}

abstract = {The evolution towards Smart Grids (SGs) represents an important opportunity for modernization of the energy industry. It is characterized by a bidirectional flow of information and energy between consumers and suppliers. However, the rapid increase of energy demands in residential areas is becoming a challenging problem. In order to address this issue, Demand-Side Management (DSM) has proven to be an effective solution. In this paper, we propose LOSISH, a price-based Demand Response (DR) system for load scheduling in residential Smart Homes (SHs) that achieves a trade-off between electricity payments and consumer’s discomfort. Our proposed system considers Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV). We formulate our scheduling as a constrained optimization problem and we propose a new hybrid algorithm to solve it. The latter combines two well known heuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). Moreover, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on Machine Learning (ML) to extract consumer’s preferences from a real dataset that contains the historical consumption patterns of his smart appliances. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a SH and we set up an experiment to evaluate our algorithm on a Raspberry Pi and measure its energy consumption. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with another approach from the literature in terms of electricity bill, Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR), energy consumption, and execution time. Numerical results show that LOSISH outperforms the other approach in terms of electricity bill (up to 52.92% cheaper), PAR (up to 44% decrease in peak demands), energy consumption (up to 69.44% less consumption), and execution time (up to 63.15% faster).}

Smart Plug for the LoRaWAN (SPLW) has been designed to measure and control the energy consumed by electrical loads in households, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, etc. with the purpose of achieving energy efficiency. SPLW monitors several electrical parameters (i.e., voltage, current, power, energy) and sends this information in real time to the cloud. A LoRa Bee associated to an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a PZEM-004 t sensor collects the necessary information in order to send it to the LoRaWAN gateway. This data is sent to The Things of Network (TTN) service, created specifically for LoRaWAN IoT applications. TTN offers numerous integrations, e.g. Ubidots has been used for WebApp and smartphone monitoring. Tests have been performed in six households to demonstrate the performance of SPLW in terms of its functionality, simplicity, reliability and cost.}

Furthermore, travel behaviors are characterized by dynamic at different time and locations, displaying the rule of urban traffic operation. This paper utilizes smart card data in two cities with different geographical features to analyze the temporal–spatial characteristics of urban travel behaviors. More specifically, by creating travel networks based on the pick-up and drop-off stations and the passenger population among these stations, an interesting observation is that the community structure of travel networks owns a metabolic trend and a stable feature simultaneously. The finding shows that the traffic system can be managed in several parts. Moreover, similar mobility patterns exist in some stations, which can be organized and controlled in the same way. Finally, travel behaviors are related to the urban layout and structure, so the distribution of urban areas can be understood better. Experiments provide enlightening insights for policy makers to comprehend the urban travel behaviors, thus improving the rail transit service plans and scheduling strategies.}

Scholars, economists, and policymakers have examined the effects of innovation in this field as well as the resulting impact on the competitiveness and attractiveness of cities, regions, and urban areas. In the knowledge age, the importance of new generations and the trend towards high-skilled human capital are key factors in urban and national development. In this study, we aim to examine the role played by high-tech firms in the city context and its influence on the attraction of knowledge flow and analyse the moderating role of youth entrepreneurship in those relationships. Using the Spatial Panel data model, we evaluated the student flow interconnections in 30 Italian cities for a 10-year period (2009–2019). As a result, we found that the city attractiveness in terms of student mobility is influenced by the capacity of cities to generate and promote innovation in terms of high-tech firms at the local and spatial levels. These findings suggest that local high-tech firms in cities can influence the knowledge inflow and students' mobility while youth entrepreneurship in cities positively affects this relationship. The obtained results could serve as a good basis to enhance the city development policies in terms of innovation and knowledge, as well as the implementation of smart city projects.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic prompted rapid, reflexive transition from face-to-face to online healthcare. For group-based addiction services, evidence for the impact on service delivery and participant experience is limited.
Methods
A 12-month (plus 2-month follow-up) pragmatic evaluation of the upscaling of online mutual-help groups by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) was conducted using The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data captured by SRAU between 1st July 2020 and 31st August 2021 included participant questionnaires, Zoom Data Analytics and administrative logs.
Results
Reach: The number of online groups increased from just 6 pre-COVID-19 to 132. These groups were delivered on 2786 (M = 232.16, SD = 42.34 per month) occasions, to 41,752 (M = 3479.33, SD = 576.34) attendees. Effectiveness: Participants (n = 1052) reported finding the online group meetings highly engaging and a positive, recovery supportive experience. 91 % of people with experience of face-to-face group meetings rated their online experience as equivalent or better. Adoption: Eleven services (including SRAU) and five volunteers delivered group meetings for the entire 12-months. Implementation: SRAU surpassed their goal of establishing 100 groups. Maintenance: The average number of meetings delivered [t(11.14) = -1.45, p = 0.1737] and attendees [t(1.95) = -3.28, p = 0.1880] per month were maintained across a two-month follow-up period.
Conclusions
SRAU scaled-up the delivery of online mutual-help groups in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings support the accessibility, acceptability and sustainability of delivering SMART Recovery mutual-help groups online. Not only are these findings important in light of the global pandemic and public safety, but they demonstrate the potential for reaching and supporting difficult and under-served populations.}

Radiative cooling technologies promise to reduce building energy consumption and create thermal comfort for human beings in the hot season. However, the persistent thermal radiation of cooling materials in cold times exacerbates the heating cost and personal thermal discomfort for passive applications. In response to this practically important challenge, switchable radiative cooling technologies have been proposed, opening an avenue for dynamically cooling or heating objects as the ambient temperature changes. According to the approaches of external stimuli, we categorize the present switchable radiative cooling technologies into actively and passively adaptive systems. Then, we review recent research progress on such intelligent strategies for building applications and personal thermal management, especially emphasizing their respective working mechanisms. Finally, we identify current challenges and future opportunities for developing advanced and multifunctional smart radiative cooling technologies.}

In the 1960s, Jacobs created the conditions for institutional change by offering a thorough critique of the “Radiant Garden City Beautiful” orthodoxy of urban planning and presenting a solution for the problems that she saw with this approach. She argued that the top-down, design-oriented planning of her time hurt the lives of individual residents and diminished society as a whole. Her solution was a new way of seeing the city: as a functional and efficient social system. Since the 1990s, a global planning orthodoxy – of which Jacobs' ideas are part – developed around the “Smart Sustainable Resilient City.” This orthodoxy has been subject to critique, but Susan Fainstein's Just City theory offers tools for comprehensively challenging the approach and a solution for addressing the problems. In order to demonstrate the need for institutional change within the Smart Sustainable Resilient City orthodoxy, I use the Just City theoretical perspective to interpret the results of an analysis of green gentrification in New York City between 1990 and 2014. I argue that the over-valuation of Jacobsian diversity within the current urban planning orthodoxy generates unjust outcomes. The just green city, then, requires de-emphasizing Jacobs' intellectual project in favor of her far more important institutional project.}

As one of the most important applications for IoT, sustainable smart manufacturing enables lower cost, higher productivity and flexibility, better quality and sustainability during the product lifecycle management. Over the years, numerous enterprises have promoted the implementation of both sustainable and smart manufacturing. In the Industry 4.0 context, a ‘digital twin’ is widely used to achieve smart manufacturing, although this approach often ignores sustainability. This study aims to simultaneously consider digital twin and big data technologies to propose a sustainable smart manufacturing strategy based on information management systems for energy-intensive industries (EIIs) from the product lifecycle perspective. The integration of digital twin and big data provides key technologies for data acquisition in energy-intensive production environments, prediction and mining in uncertain environments as well as real-time control in complex working conditions. Moreover, a digital twin-driven operation mechanism and an overall framework of big data cleansing and integration are designed to explain and illustrate sustainable smart manufacturing. Two case studies from Southern and Northern China demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy, with the results showing that Companies A and B achieved the goals of energy saving and cost reduction after implementing the proposed strategy. By applying an energy management system, the unit energy consumption and energy cost of production in Company A decreased by at least 3%. In addition, the ‘cradle-to-gate’ lifecycle big data analysis indicates that the costs of environmental protection in Company B decrease significantly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and some managerial insights for EIIs in China are analysed and discussed.}

Despite this, uncertainty remains on how intra-gendered dynamics influence its adoption in dryland farming systems. This study implements both quantitative and qualitative approaches including household surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions to explore how intra-gender dynamics shape the perceptions and adoption of climate-smart agriculture in three selected communities (Katanga, Dakio, and Zonno) in the Bolgatanga East District of the Upper East Region of Ghana. Specifically, the study answers the following research questions: (i) What is the degree of change in rainfall and temperature in the Bolgatanga East District? (ii) How does gender shape the perception of smallholder farmers on climate variability in the study communities? (iii) Which CSA interventions are employed by smallholder farming households in the study communities? (iv) Which socio-demographic factors influence intra-gendered perceptions and adoption of CSA in the study communities? Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors influencing male and female farmers’ perceptions and adoption of climate-smart agriculture. Rainfall and temperature trends from 2010 to 2020 were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test. We found that over the past ten years, smallholder farmers in the district have seen rising temperatures and erratic rainfall patterns. Less educated female smallholder farmers adopted CSA interventions relative to more educated female farmers. Married male smallholder farmers employed CSA interventions on their farms compared to single and divorced male farmers. The adoption of CSA was higher for female farmers with inherited farmland than for those with rented land. Our results indicate that the source of income and farming experience influence male smallholder farmers’ adoption of crop rotation and their decision to diversify crops on their farms. The farmland tenure system, farming experience, and income source of female farmers influence their choice to change planting dates. The study recommends the integration of intra-gendered dynamics in policy reforms to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers with different socioeconomic characteristics to climate variability in Ghana.}

Smart homes/buildings are key sub-categories of smart grids. The advanced metering infrastructure connected to them continuously captures and stores the energy consumption data as datasets. Usually, understanding the structure of data and the behaviour of customers from energy consumption datasets is a tedious task. There are some literature works tried to explore various smart home energy consumption datasets as well as investigate customer behaviour, however, most of these methods are complex in implementation. Hence, this paper proposes a simple approach for the comprehensive exploration of the smart home energy consumption dataset. This approach can be used for any similar smart home dataset that contains numerical data. Further, using the exploration results, this paper analyzes the customers’ energy consumption behaviour by identifying peak hours in communication and electrical perspectives. To implement the proposed approach, an energy consumption dataset ‘Tracebase’ is considered as a case study. The exploration of the considered dataset results in 2356 files distributed among various directories. For customer behaviour analysis, the energy consumption data of all 43 appliances (with more than 95 million records) is considered from the “complete” directory of the “Tracebase” dataset. This analysis revealed the peak hours as hour-23 from the communication perspective and hour-9 from the electrical perspective. These represent the customer behaviour in terms of their participation in the power network, which further helps for better grid operations.}

However, the deployment process of these smart wireless devices when delivered to customer premises is slow and error prone as each of them needs to be provisioned with authentication credentials to access the corporate network. In this paper, we propose HANNA, a human-friendly provisioning and configuration framework for smart devices, that extends the zero-touch paradigm to large IoT deployments by introducing voice assisted configuration in combination with large scale ad-hoc communications to overcome the initial installation effort of IoT deployments. The most prominent role in HANNA is played by the assisting device, which includes a voice assistant capable of correctly understanding a minimum number of keywords required for initial provisioning and configuration of the devices. The device’s role is to interact with the user and ensure that all provisioning details are received. These are then converted into appropriate machine instructions for further use by the mass provisioning mechanism. We provide an example prototype implementation of HANNA and evaluate the performance of the assisting device in the human-to-machine communication phase and the performance of the selected communication technique in the machine-to-machine communication phase. Our results show the potential of existing speech-to-text engines for this application area and also reveal shortcomings with respect to the robustness of the engines in office-like working environments as well as with respect to user’s gender and language proficiency level. Additionally we show that the proposed machine-to-machine provisioning approach is always faster compared to manual provisioning for cases with more than ten devices.}

However, most current phrase searchable encryption schemes still don't support dynamic data updates in practical application scenarios such as smart healthcare due to forward security issues. In this article, a dynamic forward secure searchable encryption scheme with phrase search for smart healthcare systems is proposed. On the one hand, we adopt a state chain structure to construct an inverted index, which contains the location of keywords so as to achieve phrase search. On the other hand, we have added a modification operation that modifies the location of keywords directly by traversing the inverted index to achieve indexes update. In this way, the efficiency of data updating can be raised greatly because the update operation of first-delete-then-add is avoided in the previous phrase search scheme. The scheme is proved to satisfy the forward security in the leaked search pattern and access pattern since the server cannot know the updated state of updated files in the state chain index structure which is randomly generated by the client.

abstract = {Water rights trading is commonly used as a means of water resources reallocation between different water use sectors or between different end-users within the same sector. No studies, however, were reported on water rights trading from residential water use to other sectors. The primary reasons include the ambiguous definition of residents’ water rights and lack of real-time information about water consumption. This study presents a domestic-industrial water permits trading framework for urban water demand management. The framework is applied to the case study of Dalian demonstrating its feasibility theoretically and technologically from the perspective of the whole city and typical demonstration areas. The finding obtained shows that the tradable water volume accounts for 13.72% of the total residential water use, brings a profit of 91.05 million yuan to the residents, and saves 56.67 million yuan of water resources costs for industry users. The increase in water prices for consumption through tiered pricing can raise the tradable volume to 16.10%. Furthermore, a trading platform based on WeChat is developed to completely materialize the entire water permits trading process according to the real-time water consumption data collected from smart water meters. This study shows that the water permits trading between urban domestic-industrial sectors is an effective means of redistributing urban water resources to improve economic benefits while ensuring urban water supply security.}

The goal of this work is a cooperative navigation system to achieve cooperative collision avoidance for enhancing the safety and capacity of the intersection. This work considers cooperative connected autonomous vehicles operating simultaneously with non-cooperative autonomous vehicles. This work uses beyond visual range scenarios to reduce the vulnerable situations. Beyond visual range, information is implemented by using the data from the roadside units, autonomous intersection management system, smart traffic lights, and onboard units. The efficacy of this work is validated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results show the separation time within the set upper and lower bounds. That ensures that the ego vehicle does not collide with others at the intersection. The cooperative collision avoidance algorithm guides the ego vehicle as soon as the ego vehicle comes in the range of the intersection service area, which increases the safety and capacity of the intersection. This strategy is comfortably used for both an unsignalized and signalized intersection. In an unsignalized intersection scenario, the ego vehicle uses an onboard unit. In signalized intersection scenario, the ego vehicle uses a roadside unit, onboard unit, autonomous intersection management system, and smart traffic lights. As no such framework is found in the literature. The proposed framework is the near-future requirement where the connected autonomous vehicle utilizes the information from smart infrastructure devices.}

abstract = {The occurrence of faults in textile manufacturing methods results in major wastage of the properties. Additionally, it also affects the quality of the fabric products. Manual inspection methods fail to detect the defects with respect to efficiency, accuracy, and consistency due to size of the detects, carelessness, and optical illusion. Therefore, automatic fabric inspection has become a powerful tool to optimize the quality of fabric. In this background, the current study develops a novel Hybrid Mutation Moth Flame Optimization with Deep Learning-Based Smart Fabric Defect Detection (HMFODL-FDD) technique for sustainable manufacturing. The proposed HMFODL-FDD technique exploits the Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for the detection of defects in fabric. To accomplish this objective, the presented HMFODL-FDD technique employs contrast enhancement process to boost the quality of the images. For feature extraction, the HMFODL-FDD technique uses Inception v3 model with HMFO algorithm-based hyperparameter optimizer. Finally, the classification of the fabric defects is performed using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model. The experimental outcomes confirmed that the proposed HMFODL-FDD technique achieved superior performance over DL techniques in terms of effective defect classification in fabric images with a maximum accuracy of 95.47%.}

abstract = {Global climate change is aggravating the occurrence of pests and diseases, however, pesticide residue caused by the abuse of chemical pesticides is emerging as a worldwide issue with a great threat to the ecological environment, human health, and food security. Biopesticide application, a component of climate-smart agricultural practices, is viewed as a vital alternative for agricultural sustainable development. Due to the additional cost attached to externalities and information insufficiency, the adoption rates of biopesticide are still quite low in most developing countries. By using panel data of 3143 rural households from 2020 to 2021 in Jiangsu Province, this paper builds a theoretical framework of whether and how specialized agricultural service (SAS) for specialized pest control affects farmers' biopesticide application, and then employs an Endogenous Switching Probit model to verify this effect and its channels empirically. The empirical results show that the SAS purchase can increase significantly the probability of smallholders' biopesticide adoption by 30.8%. Without consideration of the self-selection bias, this probability would drop to 16.2%. The potential channels of the SAS influencing farmers' biopesticide application are technology popularization (training) and machinery substitution resulting from SAS. Moreover, our findings also indicate that the effects of SAS on biopesticide adoption are heterogeneous, and vary with farmers' education level, cooperative members, and land size. This paper provides the first empirical evidence for the effect of SAS on biopesticide promotion, which is expected to contribute to agricultural sustainable development and food safety in most developing countries.}

Due to the high density and concurrent communication, the primary goal is to provide an efficient authentication for massive enhanced Machine Type Communication (eMTC) devices. However, certain security flaws have been discovered in the 5G-AKA protocol, and no scheme has yet been developed that meets the needs of a group of eMTC devices, such as signaling congestion avoidance, key forward/backward secrecy (KFS/KBS) establishment, resistance against malicious attacks, and session key secrecy. Furthermore, the current group-based 5G communication network techniques do not require the group membership update mechanism at each device joining or leaving the group. To address these issues, we present a lightweight and secure technique for assembling a secure ecosystem of eMTC devices in a 5G network. The protocol employs the incremental hash mechanism to complete group member joining/leaving activities. For a thorough assessment of LS-AKA, the Random Oracle Model (ROM) is used to do formal security proofs, and informal security analysis shows that it is resistant to malicious attacks. In addition, the performance and simulation results of the existing and suggested protocols in terms of signaling, communication, and computing overhead are analyzed. According to the assessment results, the LS-AKA protocol improves the privacy and confidentiality of the 5G-enabled smart environment.}

Drawing on 23 interviews with partner organisations in 12 UK SLES projects, we investigate the targets, methods and rationales of engagement. Partners engage a range of user and community groups around multiple energy system components using a variety of methods, directly and via intermediary organisations. Project size is not a major influence on breadth and intensity of engagement. Project partners rationalise practices with reference to characterisations of users and engagement, and practices are conditioned by a range of factors (e.g. technological boundaries, place, partners involved, and the wider organisational context within which SLES projects take place). We highlight a need for future SLES policy to emphasise engagement as a key facet, institute systematic social learning between SLES projects, and consider how to engage publics beyond the boundaries of individual projects.}

However, privacy and security preservation of mobile users becomes an important issue due to the open and public nature of communication channels. To address this issue, many roaming authentication schemes have been recently proposed. In this article, we first review the work presented by Ghahramani et al., and demonstrate its weaknesses. We then propose a provably secure and efficient authentication and key agreement scheme for roaming users in GLOMONETs in the smart city. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we first perform a comprehensive descriptive discussion on security preservation and utilise the widely accepted Scyther tool. We then consider the computational complexity and communication overhead of the proposed scheme, and compare it with the recent related work. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme in terms of very low computation and communication overhead as well as resistance against well-known security attacks.}

With full use of the emerging knowledge-based smart management technology, SROM will further increase comprehensive efficiency and save human resources greatly at the same time, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Hence, we propose a systematic knowledge-based smart management method to transfer SROM activities from human operations to automatic response by means of knowledge explicitation, organization, sharing and reusing, which can be further achieved by employing knowledge graph. We took a typical SROM instance, ISO 9000 implementation management, as an example to validate the transformation from human activities to knowledge graph-based automatic operation. We firstly analyzed characteristics of domain knowledge and constructed an ontology model according to the knowledge stability. Secondly, a hybrid knowledge graph construction and dynamic updating framework together with related algorithms were designed by deliberately integrating semantic similarity calculation and natural language processing. Thirdly, we developed a question-answering mechanism and reasoning system based on the ISO 9000 implementation knowledge graph to support automatic decision and feedback for ISO 9000 routine operation management including knowledge learning and processes auditing. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of SROM knowledge graph has been validated in a SME in China, realizing the application of question-answering, job responsibility recommendation, conflict detection, semantic detection, multidimensional statistical analysis. The proposed method can also be generalized to support auxiliary optimization decision, vertical risk control, operation mode analysis, optimization model improvement experience and so on.}

Techno-optimism has captured the imagination of media, industry, and governments alike. Simultaneously, researchers in the computer science and machine learning spaces have begun cataloguing potential harms that arise from information technologies that are shaped by bias, discrimination, and Western hierarchies of power. While precision agriculture and smart farming technologies may provide some opportunities for East African smallholder women farmers, they may also emerge as a new—yet familiar—system of appropriation and control over their labor and knowledge. Concurrently, there is a need to address how such technologies continue to reinforce plants as mere objects to be optimized and managed, rather than “smart” beings with their own material forces and ways of knowing that shape our worlds. This article considers how precision agriculture and smart farming are potentially managing, surveilling, and optimizing both women farmers and plants in ways that reinforce hierarchies and disregard Indigenous ways of knowing and being. It models a decolonial mode of deliberation toward governing smart farming and related artificially intelligent technologies in more meaningful and inclusive ways.}

Incentive mechanism is one of the promising measures to improve the participation of residents in waste recycling activities. However, several defects have been observed in the incentive-based waste recycling systems: (1) inefficient allocation of resources in recycling services, (2) deficient systems lacking future planning, and (3) limitations in circulating responsive feedback amongst stakeholders. For overcoming these defects, a smart incentive-based recycling system is designed using the Internet of Things and data analysis technologies. Four key components in the designed system—namely, amount pattern discovery, price adjustment suggestion, waste-collection amount forecasting, and information sharing amongst stakeholders—assist in constructing a smarter system to enhance waste recycling. A basic incentive-based recycling system in Shanghai, with data on 19 specific recyclable items from 21 August 2018 to 20 March 2019, was improved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed system. For the case of a pilot community, the recyclable waste-collection amount increased 229.3%, but the weekly pattern of collection amount got imbalanced, especially at weekends. The weekly pattern analyses suggested adjusting the pricing for cardboard, strawboard, plastic bottles, and old clothing amongst the six identified items (i.e. taking ~80.0% by weight) to balance the collection amount and allocate resources better for waste-collection operations. The two-month trend analysis and fortnight forecasting help to make plans rationally for recycling businesses. Under the new information-sharing platform, stakeholders could collaborate smoothly in household waste recycling and reduction.}

Typical biomarkers, sortase A and pyocyanin, corresponding to two major types of bacterial infection, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected with electrochemical differential pulse voltammetry. Ti3C2Tx MXene was applied to the electrode to enhance the sensitivity. Pyocyanin could transfer electrons with the electrode for sensing due to its redox characteristics, while a peptide labeled with the electroactive ferrocene was customized for the specific recognition of sortase A. The integration of near field communication module realized wireless energy harvesting and data transmission with the smartphone. The fully integrated system demonstrated good linearity and high sensitivity, with wide detection ranges of 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL for sortase A, and 1 μM to 100 μM for pyocyanin. Furthermore, the animal studies indicated the effectiveness of the smart bandage for multi-biomarker profiling of wound.

An important facet of balancing these consequences - both preserving the benefits while recognising and compensating for the challenges - is determining the conditions for the distribution of digital sovereignty that best achieves this balance. This piece offers only a steppingstone toward this wider project by examining the most important moral issues raised by the introduction and use of wearables for individual users, with the aim of arriving at a set of crucial moral considerations that the current designers and purveyors of these technologies have a moral duty to reflect and act upon to ensure the distribution of individual digital sovereignty best able to balance the benefits and challenges. The result of this will be a set of moral calculi that any attempt to distribute digital sovereignty smart wearables will have to consider and address if it is to provide a morally satisfactory distribution.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in low-voltage distribution networks has caused reverse power flow leading to voltage rise. As the voltage level increases, PV inverters first reduce the output power to regulate the voltage and may eventually shut down if the voltage level remains above the permissible limit. When this happens, the PV output power is curtailed, leading to financial loss. This paper examines two control strategies to reduce PV curtailment: (1) smart PV inverters and (2) residential battery storage system optimally sized to reduce the cost of household energy. Smart PV inverters can reduce the voltage level by absorbing reactive power at the expense of curtailing its active power output. Residential battery storage can reduce the voltage level by storing excess PV power instead of exporting it to the grid Using these two strategies, a systematic approach is presented to reduce PV curtailment and the associated financial loss. Three types of electricity tariffs are used, namely, electricity market pool price, and retail flat and time of use tariffs for household customers. An 11-kV distribution feeder in South Australia is analysed with the prevailing feeder and inverter voltage limits per Australian regulatory standards. The results demonstrate that installing 100% of PV systems with smart inverters and optimally sized battery storage can reduce the PV curtailment and the corresponding financial losses by 47%.}

abstract = {Sharing Internet of Things (IoT) data across different sectors, such as in smart cities, becomes complex due to heterogeneity. This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fog–edge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity.}

abstract = {Photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EVs) are two emerging technologies often considered as cornerstones in the energy and transportation systems of future sustainable cities. They both have to be integrated into the power systems and be operated together with already existing loads and generators and, often, into buildings, where they potentially impact the overall energy performance of the buildings. Thus, a high penetration of both PV and EVs poses new challenges. Understanding of the synergies between PV, EVs and existing electricity consumption is therefore required. Recent research has shown that smart charging of EVs could improve the synergy between PV, EVs and electricity consumption, leading to both technical and economic advantages. Considering the growing interest in this field, this review paper summarizes state-of-the-art studies of smart charging considering PV power production and electricity consumption. The main aspects of smart charging reviewed are objectives, configurations, algorithms and mathematical models. Various charging objectives, such as increasing PV utilization and reducing peak loads and charging cost, are reviewed in this paper. The different charging control configurations, i.e., centralized and distributed, along with various spatial configurations, e.g., houses and workplaces, are also discussed. After that, the commonly employed optimization techniques and rule-based algorithms for smart charging are reviewed. Further research should focus on finding optimal trade-offs between simplicity and performance of smart charging schemes in terms of control configuration, charging algorithms, as well as the inclusion of PV power and load forecast in order to make the schemes suitable for practical implementations.}

While smart sensors and IoT technologies have great potential to transform public service provision, their adoption in the public sector seems to be slow and incremental. Using cross-sectional data of 65 large and mid-sized cities in the United States, we examine what affects local governments' adoption of smart and connected sensors. We propose a path-dependence explanation for the incremental adoption and test if a local government's sensor adoption behavior is shaped by its existing policy priorities and managerial practices in related fields. Our results show that local governments' early adoption of smart sensors is likely to stem from their needs in specific policy domains. We also find that a local government's historical paths on urban sustainability and data-driven decision-making practices can predict its trajectory of sensor deployment, in terms of the scope and the integration of smart sensors across different urban domains. Surprisingly, a local government's e-government progressiveness is not a significant predictor. Our results confirm the incremental change in smart sensor adoption and provide implications for local governments' IoT planning.}

During the last two decades, a growing body of literature has used this sort of data source to study the behaviour of public transport users in cities and regions around the world. However, its use has been scarce in contexts where public transport demand is highly influenced by the activities of the tourist sector. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these data can be leveraged to optimize the supply of public transport. In this article, data drawn from the Camp de Tarragona automated fare collection system extracted during 2018 are used to study tourists' use of public transport in Costa Daurada (Catalonia, Spain). This is a popular coastal destination with a high concentration of visitors during the summer period. The analysis focuses on the use of the T-10, a multipersonal transport fare with no time limitations on its use which makes it appealing for tourists. Model-based clustering has been applied to identify different clusters of passengers according to their activity and spatial profiles. Differences between profiles are significant and, as a result, this study allowed the validation of a method that could be replicated in other contexts, as it provides highly useful information for public transport policy and mobility management.}

This paper critically explores the role of autonomous (driverless) vehicles in plans for urban futures. By looking into the urban plans of 10 European capitals, we investigate the anticipated promises and hazards of autonomous vehicles. Theoretically, the paper draws upon critical urban mobilities studies that invite interlinking carbon reduction, smart cities and mobility planning. By examining these plans, the paper critically evaluates current urban planning for autonomous vehicles by asking whether one can identify any links to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of sustainable cities and communities. A practice-based view on automation is then suggested as a pathway to promote a thorough sustainable mobility transition. It is concluded that none of the plans of the 10 capitals studied require AVs to integrate with public means of transport or to be fuelled by renewable energy sources. Hence, AVs are likely to individualise and intensify the existing automobility regime further and emissions are likely to increase, according to the comparative urban analysis. We therefore conclude that urban policy-making needs to contest the existing techno-centric conception of autonomous vehicles if these are to support the sustainable development goals of cities.}

The study aims to define the most crucial spatial patterns for analyses from the point of view of possibilities of implementation of solutions aimed at smart local development of rural areas within the smart villages projects based on the case study of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship in Poland. In the paper we define parameters for spatial analyses that allow to determine possible directions of development and select following areas: (i) predestined to the development of agricultural retail trade and direct sale, (ii) predisposed to introduction of precise agriculture, (iii) predisposed to development of systems permitting production and sale of solar energy to the electricity network, (iv) predisposed to development of systems permitting heating of water and houses from renewable energy sources, (v) predisposed to development of ecological agriculture and traditional food production, (vi) weakly developed and peripheral areas that require the support of development processes or areas with particularly unfavourable spatial structure of land and farms prioritised for land consolidation procedures, (vii) under the influence of large urban centre that are participating in development processes. The study proved that agrarian and spatial structure can considerably affect the possibilities of smart development of a given area.}

The task of anomaly detection is made difficult by the presence of complex environments and varying perspectives, even in diverse situations. Furthermore, the lack of labeled data in this field presents additional challenges. In this article, we present a robust pyramidal frame prediction architecture coupled with an efficient anomaly detection mechanism. The foundation of the frame prediction module rests upon a combination of localized predictors, incorporating bidirectional sampling techniques and a proficient discriminator-sharing mechanism. For the purpose of anomaly detection, an innovative loss function is employed, tailored to accommodate multi-instance learning scenarios. Departing from the conventional treatment of anomalies as a binary classification problem, we adopt a regression-oriented approach, thereby enabling a nuanced understanding of disruptive occurrences at a granular level, whilst facilitating an assessment of the severity associated with anomalous events. The amalgamation of these dual modules culminates in a distinctive and robust framework adept at comprehending anomalies within intricate scenarios. Empirical assessments conducted across benchmark datasets within this domain serve to underscore the efficacy of the proposed architectural paradigm across a spectrum of environments.}

In this paper, we propose IoT-MAC, a downlink traffic-aware Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for automation in smart spaces. The proposed scheme uses new RAW frames to schedule downlink actuation traffic, considering the periodicity and freshness of uplink traffic. IoT-MAC identifies the periodicity of uplink traffic and schedules a frame without further contention. It then prioritizes critical downlink traffic without losing fresh uplink data. The performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows significant improvement in terms of throughput, delay, power consumption and packet loss for running different IoT applications.}

In the last two decades, smart card data has provided the opportunity to create comprehensive travel demand data as a byproduct of a fare-collecting system. One important attribute for the planning is the purpose of the trips, which is missing from the smart card data. This research study proposes and formulates a novel method to infer trip purpose in smart card data. Previous methods either lack the concept of trip chains or did not consider both spatial and temporal perspectives of a trip. Firstly, this method discovers relations between the sequence and temporal attributes of trips with their trip purpose attribute by running a clustering method on a rich travel survey dataset (This study only uses public transit records.) that contains all attributes. Secondly, the discovered clusters are labelled and transferred to the smart card data by calculating the closeness of the trip chain of each individual in the smart card data to the clusters. Thirdly, the proportion of relevant land use types near the destination of each trip is utilized to enhance the previously calculated closeness. The proposed method is implemented on datasets from South East Queensland, Australia. Also, two recently published methods were replicated and run on the same datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The results show improvements in the proposed method compared to the existing methods of the literature.}

abstract = {The transport sector plays a decisive role in climate change mitigation, especially in cities, as it significantly contributes to global resource and energy consumption. Hence, decarbonising this sector is increasingly recognized as an important means of mitigating climate change, which is reflected in numerous smart city initiatives. However, existing studies thereon have focused almost exclusively on energy and CO2, thereby neglecting the consumption of material resources required to transform urban transport systems so as to be compatible with a low carbon future. In this study, we hence investigate the effects of transforming urban transport systems on future material stock and material flows using the city of Vienna as a case study. For this purpose, a material flow analysis for the infrastructure and vehicles required until 2050 has been conducted taking different scenarios into consideration, which are mainly characterized by different modal splits. The results show that different paths of development among the various transport modes significantly affect the overall material stocks and flows. If the modal split remains constant, the road-infrastructure has to be further expended to provide the transport service needed due to the expected increase in population in Vienna. The material stock per capita for the transport system remains constant at around 54 t/capita for this scenario. If the motorized individual transport can be reduced to a share of less than 10% of all trips (today's share amounts to 25%), the material stock per capita decreases to around 47 t/capita in 2050. As this case allows for infrastructure (e.g. parking infrastructure, road lanes) to be dismantled, the annual material demand for maintenance efforts is also reduced by a fifth (to 460 kg/cap/yr). Despite the reduction in material stocks and flows achievable by changing the current modal split, a significant change in the waste composition in terms of the end-of-life vehicles generated is to be expected in the coming decades. Annual quantities of old batteries, for instance, might rise from today's 1.5 kg/capita up to 70 kg/capita. These changes will definitely challenge the waste management sector, but also represent an opportunity for the recovery of valuable resources. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the transformation of an urban transport system towards lower greenhouse gas emissions also has the potential to reduce future material demand and waste generation. However, this requires a change in the modal split, whereas solely moving to a fossil-free vehicle fleet has the contrary effect.}

Therefore, effective EVSC strategies and technologies are required to address such challenges. This review paper outlines the benefits and challenges of the EVSC procedure from different points of view. The role of EV aggregator in EVSC, charging methods and objectives, and required infrastructure for implementing EVSC are discussed. The study also deals with ancillary services provided by EVSC and EVs' load forecasting approaches. Moreover, the EVSC integrated energy systems, including homes, buildings, integrated energy systems, etc., are reviewed, followed by the smart green charging solutions to enhance the environmental benefit of EVs. The literature review shows the efficiency of EVSC in reducing charging costs by 30 %, grid operational costs by 10 %, and renewable curtailment by 40 %.

This paper would like to determine the commonly used messaging protocols and electronic platforms, and the messaging protocols’ performance comparison, in building smart homes purposes, by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Based on our study, we found out that the commonly used messaging protocols are MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and DDS, and it shows that MQTT performs better than other protocols as it has wide network bandwidth and a low size packets transferred. The commonly used electronic platforms are Raspberry Pi, Arduino and DDS.}

abstract = {The following literature review sets out the state-of-the-art research relating to smart building principles and smart energy systems in UK higher education university campuses. The paper begins by discussing the carbon impact of the sector and the concept of ‘smart campuses' applied to the sector in the context of decarbonisation. Opportunities and challenges associated with integrating smart energy systems at the university campus from a policy and technical perspective are then discussed. This is followed by a review of building and campus-scale frameworks supporting a transition to smart energy campuses using the BPIE’ Smart Buildings' framework. The paper finds that the complexity of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for new and existing higher education buildings and energy systems can be addressed with the adoption of ‘smart building principles' and integrating 'smartness' into their energy systems. Several universities in the UK and worldwide are integrating smart services and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their operations following the smart campus premise. At the building level, existing frameworks often create conceptual roadmaps for the smart building premise or propose technical implementation and assessment methods. At university campus scale, implementation typically comes through single-vector interventions, and only few examples exist that propose a multi-vector approach. Comparisons of the drivers and the decision-making process are made, with carbon and cost reduction being the most prominent from leveraging distributed energy generation. Therefore, this study identified the need for a comprehensive technical or policy framework to drive the uptake of the smart energy campus, aiming to bring together the holistic value of smart energy campuses.}

This paper describes the events that prompted this reduction. We look at how changes in water use were affected by official announcements and by public engagement with this news via the social media activity and internet searches. We analysed the water usage of a subset of middle to high income households where smart hot and cold water meters were installed. For hot water usage patterns we compared meter readings with that in another area unaffected by the drought. We further map our cold water smart meter readings against that of the City of Cape Town's municipal data for domestic freestanding households — a sample of more than 400,000 households. We found that the introduction of Level 5 restrictions had a perverse effect on consumption, possibly due to confusing messages. The most dramatic change in behaviour appears to have been instigated by a media storm and consequent user panic after the release of the City's Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan in October 2017. However, contradictory communication from national and provincial government eroded some of this gain. The paper concludes with recommendations for demand management in a similar future scenario.}

Factors influencing adoption are unclear, however. Starting with the technology, organizational and environmental (TOE) model, we examined factors influencing smart grid adoption using a mixed methods approach that included interviews and a survey of utility representatives. We found that utilities were primarily motivated by internal goals such as cost reduction and improved operational performance, and less by external factors such as customer demand or pressure to accommodate renewables. They were inhibited by the perception that technologies are still immature and by a lack of funds to invest. Larger utilities, IOUs, and more technologically opportunistic firms had higher levels of adoption. Structural topic modeling of interviews identified findings not captured in the TOE framework, such as the importance of relationships between utilities and regulators, and the overlapping roles of cooperative member/customers. These interactions are better explained within the institutional logics perspective, which can enrich understanding of smart grid adoption beyond TOE. Policy recommendations are offered to facilitate adoption through regulatory changes, financial support to utilities, and support of standardization.}

One of the crucial aspects of HEMS are proper load forecasting and scheduling of energy utilization. Energy management systems depend heavily on precise forecasting and scheduling. Considering this scenario, this article was divided into two parts. Firstly, this article gives a thorough analysis of forecasting models in HEMs with the primary goal of determining whichever model is most appropriate in a given situation. Moreover, for optimal utilization of scheduling strategies in HEMs, the current literature has discussed a number of scheduling optimization approaches. Therefore, secondly in this article, these approaches will be examined thoroughly to develop effective operating scheduling and to make wise judgments regarding usage of these techniques in HEMs. Finally, this paper also presents the future technical advancements and research gaps in load forecasting and scheduling and how they affect HEMs activities in the near future.}

However, it has become a challenging problem due to spatial-temporal demand fluctuations and heterogeneous passengers’ travel behavior, i.e., the interaction between the departure and arrival passengers. In this paper, we develop an explainable Stacking-Catboost model for passenger flow prediction combining the passenger’s return probability computation. The model explores several basic ensemble learning models and the best stacking strategy. To better characterize the macroscopic spatiotemporal travel patterns other than the micro individual travel behavior, several relevant variables such as train operation characteristics, the nearby bus stations, and points of interest are considered. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the utility of each component of the proposed model. An explainable analysis is performed to interpret information from “black box” models and quantify the contribution of each feature. We present a real-world case study conducted in the Beijing metro, demonstrating that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing techniques in hourly prediction tasks. Specifically, our approach outperforms the CategoricalBoosting (CatBoost) by up to 11.11 % and the Random Forest (RF) by up to 12.90 %, showcasing the effectiveness of incorporating macroscopic spatiotemporal travel patterns and micro individual travel behavior to enhance short-term forecasting accuracy. The global interpretability of models reveals key factors that impact performance, such as returning passenger flow, historical travel demand, and timetable data. Our results offer valuable insights into short-term forecasting challenges and provide a framework for leveraging explainable artificial intelligence to improve transportation services in urban metro systems.}

By 2020, 20% of all households in Europe will be expected to become smart homes. Although smart homes seem to be the future for homes, many customers have the perception that a transition from current homes to smart ones is unprofitable. Adopting a smart home concept requires investments for which the households desire a positive return. A question in this context is the following: for a given household, when and/or what set of home appliances/technologies should be acquired so that the investment made by householder has a positive financial return? The available tool to answer that question can be time-consuming from a practical perspective. Based on our previous work, this paper proposes a framework to help the transition from current houses to smart homes considering customized electricity usage and economic measures. A tree algorithm is developed to decrease the time needed by an economic analysis of each possible acquisition combination of smart appliances or equipment for a given user. The proposed framework is tested on 40 cases covering all Brazilian capital cities, whose results are available online and may be used directly as an approximation for economic analyses. An example of one case is described in detail. Results show that the proposed tree algorithm is able to reduce days of CPU time to solve the problem and Net Present Value should be used as an economic measure to answer the aforementioned question.}

As a result, this paper proposes a novel technique for processing heterogeneous temperature data collected by an IoT network in a smart building and transforms them into homogeneous data that can be used as an input for monitoring and control algorithms in smart buildings, optimizing their performance. The proposed technique, called IoT slicing, combines complex networks and clusters in order to reduce algorithm input errors and improve the monitoring and control of a smart building. For validating the efficiency of the algorithm, it is proposed as a case study using the IoT slicing technique to improve the operation of an algorithm to self-correct outliers in data collected by IoT networks.

Soundscape, containing anthropogenic, biological, and geological elements, can provide rich information on natural and artificial environment. However, the main challenge is the discontinuity, high cost, and low efficiency of the existing manual acquisition and computation methods. It will limit the utilization of the mass data collected by the existing soundscape acquisition equipment, with the failure to reveal the pattern and dynamics included in the soundscape, in the meantime will obstruct the promising avenue for environmental research from the auditory perspective. Given the challenges, this paper introduces an innovative Smart Soundscape Sensing (SSS) system based on the intelligent sensor network and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The technology fulfills three significant breakthroughs: (a) integrated data acquisition based on a multi-threaded acquisition strategy; (b) efficient data transmission and storage based on alternative transmission modes and storage protocols; (c) multifunctional data analysis and visualization based on automatic computation and AI technologies. Results prove that SSS can effectively uncover the evolution of soundscape and its environment, and surpass traditional hand-crafted methods, especially in long-term projects. Applying such an integrated and intelligent system can facilitate drawing out hidden insights within the soundscape, refining urban sound environment planning, and delivering a sustainable future.}

Any incipient defect manifests itself in an alteration of the component vibratory status. The proposed procedure is based on the continuous monitoring of the energetic features of the vibration signals acquired from the equipment under analysis. The considered parameter is the vibration velocity RMS value. It is representative of the amount of the fatigue stress affecting the machine. By means of a continuous monitoring of such energetic features, the user is able to plan the maintenance of the equipment, prior to impeding failures. The case study provided in this paper, can illustrate how the data from a monitored process can lead to the machine system self-awareness and, eventually, self-maintenance.

Even with the leading energy saving technologies and a lot of experience on handling with environmental issues, Japan still could not meet the target set by Kyoto Protocol. The demonstration area of “smart community” suggests Japanese exploration for low carbon strategies. It is the shift toward the emphasis on the GHG emission control in civil sector. The Japanese version of smart communities also suggests the promotion on the use of renewable and untapped energy resource as well as the collaborative energy to be used in the district level. Much more important than the technology itself, the concept of smart community in Japan makes the community and the city as a whole, setting up a system of cooperation between the industry, government and residents. Taking the city of Kitakyushu as case study, this paper introduces the current development of smart community in Japan, focusing on analyzing its potential and challenges.}

abstract = {Integrated energy systems have recently gained primary importance in clean energy transition. The combination of the electricity, heating and gas sectors can improve the overall system efficiency and integration of renewables by exploiting the synergies among the energy vectors. In particular, real-time optimization tools based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) can considerably improve the performance of systems with several conversion units and distribution networks by automatically coordinating all interacting technologies. Despite the relevance of several simulation studies on the topic, however, it is significantly harder to have an experimental demonstration of this improvement. This work presents a methodology for the real-world implementation of a novel smart control strategy for integrated energy systems, based on two coordinated MPC levels, which optimize the operation of all conversion units and all energy vectors in the short- and long-term, respectively, to account also for economic incentives on critical units. The strategy that was previously developed and evaluated in a simulation environment has now been implemented, as a supervisory controller, in the integrated energy system of a hospital in Italy. The optimal control logic is easily actuated by dynamically communicating the optimal set-points to the existing Building Management System, without having to alter the system configuration. Field data collected over a two-year period, firstly when it was business as usual and when the new operation was introduced, show that the MPC increased the economic margin and revenues from yearly incentives and lowered the amount of electricity purchased, reducing dependency on the power grid.}

Contemporary software-based solutions are composed of several software systems, that form System-of-Systems (SoS). SoS differentiating characteristics, such as emergent behavior, introduce specific issues that render their security modeling, simulation and analysis a critical challenge. The aim of this work is to investigate how Software Engineering (SE) approaches can be leveraged to model and analyze secure SoS solutions for predicting high impact (cascading) attacks at the architecture stage. In order to achieve this objective, we propose a Model Driven Engineering method, Systems-of-Systems Security (SoSSec), that comprises: (1) a modeling language (SoSSecML) for secure SoS modeling and (2) Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for security analysis of SoS architectures. To illustrate our proposed approach in terms of modeling, simulating, and discovering attacks, we have conducted a case study on a real-life smart building SoS, the Adelaide University Health and Medical School (AHMS). The results from this case study demonstrate that our proposed method discovers cascading attacks comprising of a number of individual attacks, such as a Denial of Service, that arise from a succession of exploited vulnerabilities through interactions among the constituent systems of SoS. In future work, we intend to extend SoSSec to address diverse unknown emergent behaviors and non-functional properties such as safety and trust.}

Rising rates of life expectancy of older people, and deaths due to chronic diseases (CDs) such as cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease pose many challenges to healthcare. While the feasibility of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) with a Smart Healthcare Monitoring (SHM) framework was somewhat questionable before the COVID-19 pandemic, it is now a proven commodity and is on its way to becoming ubiquitous. More health organizations are adopting RPM to enable CD management in the absence of individual monitoring. The current studies on SHM have reviewed the applications of IoT and/or Machine Learning (ML) in the domain, their architecture, security, privacy and other network related issues. However, no study has analyzed the AI and ubiquitous computing advances in SHM frameworks. The objective of this research is to identify and map key technical concepts in the SHM framework. In this context an interesting and meaningful classification of the research articles surveyed for this work is presented. The comprehensive and systematic review is based on the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” (PRISMA) approach. A total of 2540 papers were screened from leading research archives from 2016 to March 2021, and finally, 50 articles were selected for review. The major advantages, developments, distinctive architectural structure, components, technical challenges and possibilities in SHM are briefly discussed. A review of various recent cloud and fog computing based architectures, major ML implementation challenges, prospects and future trends is also presented. The survey primarily encourages the data driven predictive analytics aspects of healthcare and the development of ML models for health empowerment.}

abstract = {The rapid global increase in electric vehicle (EV) usage, driven by its low CO2 emissions, uncomplicated maintenance, and minimal operating costs, has prompted extensive research in the field of electric vehicle charging station (EVCS). The integration of EVCS into the current distribution grid poses challenges due to potential power losses and voltage variations beyond acceptable limits. This complexity is heightened by the growing penetration of randomly dispersed solar-based distributed generation (SDG) and battery energy storage system (BESS). To address these challenges, distribution static VAR compensator (DSVC) systems have been introduced, offering benefits such as enhanced power transfer capacity, improved voltage regulation, and increased system security without requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades. This study offers SCOPE, a novel multi-objective framework that unifies the optimization goals of minimizing real power loss, lowering bus voltage variation, maximizing system voltage stability, minimizing system operating costs, and mitigating CO2 emissions. The EVCS problem is optimized within this multi-objective framework utilizing an improved bald eagle search algorithm (IBESA). The proposed model accounts for vehicle to grid (V2G) capabilities and the actual driving patterns of users over a 24-h horizon. The formulation of a smart microgrid (SMG) structure is based on modifying the standard IEEE 33-bus test radial distribution network (RDN), comprising three interconnected SMGs serving residential, commercial, and industrial users. The optimization approach based on IBESA is utilized to optimize both the siting and capacity of EVCS as well as renewable energy sources (RESs). The findings show that SDG and DSVC are effective at lowering the SCOPE index, highlighting the advantages of the suggested approach.}

The rover is cheap to implement and is designed so as not to interfere with airport airside operations. The rover would move on a designated track along the runway as it is scanning for FOD. When an object is detected, a message with its location is sent to the operator via Bluetooth or the cellular network. The proposed system was able to detect objects with various sizes at different distances away from the rover.

We found that SW and BT positively influence CP, with BT having the greater influence, and economic activity moderated these relationships. Consequently, we show that manufacturing companies use SW the most, while service companies tend towards BT. No significant differences were found in the multigroup analysis by type of industry. However, there was a positive association between CP and SW only for commercialization companies, which means that these are increasingly making inroads into using SW. This paper acknowledges the contributions of previous studies, and is the first to provide researchers, practitioners, and academics with empirical evidence on SW, BT, and CP. It also broadens the understanding of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies and their impact on the CP of companies in emerging economies.}

abstract = {Power Plants (PPs) is considered as critical facilities in each region because of essential role through energy generation processes. These facilities are also depended to water availability especially in water stress areas. Due to the critical water shortage in many areas around the world, it is necessary to make an optimal condition among water consumption and the increasing demand for electricity to prevent any further conflict of interests between industry, householders and the environmental goals. There are different techniques for controlling Water Consumption (WC) in these industries. This paper develops a smart Decision Support System (DSS) for monitoring, prediction and control sections based on Artificial Intelligent (AI) and integration of the PESTEL matrix and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. Monitoring section comprises Fuel Consumption (FC), Atmospheric Temperature (AT), Power Plant Temperature (PPT) and Power Plant Efficiency (PPE), in which FC has the most influence on WC based on ANOVA evaluations in both cold and warm seasons. The prediction results have illustrated that Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System model is more efficient for the WC estimation with a correlation coefficient over 0.99. Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) also demonstrated that in the optimistic and pessimistic states, the most priority is linked to E3 (Establishment of evaporation control systems by contractor companies and concluding a guaranteed purchase contract with a power plant worth one and a half times the current amount of water price). In the last step of technical approaches, the smart controlling system is added for execution of water-energy nexus in the PP based on proportional–integral–derivative controller system. Finally, the performance of the DSS is approved with more than 80% agreement of experts and more than 90% precision in prediction procedure through this investigation. Application of this DSS can also be helpful for developing countries to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.}

How to effectively leverage these data for anomaly detection has become an increasingly popular research field as it is a fundamental aspect of cyber security for smart city services. The existing methods often focus on either static data for anomaly detection or streaming data without considering the influence of poor detection accuracy caused by concept drift phenomenon. In this paper, we concentrate on the anomaly detection problem of smart city services and distinguish different anomalies of communication in an effective way, which is aimed to protect data privacy of users. Then we propose an innovative concept drift adaptive method to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, which fully considers time influence to change the sample distribution along timeline. Furthermore, we present an AI based Improved Long Short-Term Memory (I-LSTM) neural network that adds time factor and employs a novel smooth activation function, which can enhance the performance of multi-classification for anomaly detection. Finally, our proposed methods are evaluated with a real communication dataset. Extensive experimental results indicate that I-LSTM achieves the highest values on all indicators. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods that can offer excellent quality of service for smart city, which is a perfect fusion of artificial intelligence and communication security.}

abstract = {In recent years, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of things (IoT) has attracted a lot of attention. One IoT device is the smart speaker that is equipped with an integrated assistant controlled by spoken commands. In the global smart speaker market, Chinese brands account for a significant share. Since smart speakers have a natural advantage when collecting user data in diverse scenarios, privacy and personal information protection have become crucial issues for both smart speaker manufacturers and users in China. This paper applies the socio-technical system (STS) framework to portray the technology subsystem, the industry/market subsystem and the regulators, law/regulation subsystem that are related to smart speakers in China, and how they interact with each other. It also uses focus group discussions to understand the smart speaker users' privacy concerns and the smart speaker industry's implementation of personal information protection. By employing the document analysis method, this study analyzes the laws and regulations related to privacy and personal information protection in the context of AI and the IoT. In particular, the potential impacts of the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) on smart speakers are discussed in detail. With its goal of balancing personal information protection and technological development, this paper provides recommendations for the regulatory bodies and the smart speaker industry players in China that can shed light on other countries and regions.}
