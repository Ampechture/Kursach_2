abstract = {The Industrial-Internet-of-Things (IIoT) powers several applications in the modern world: smart city, smart grid, smart manufacturing, smart logistics management, etc. The increased connectivity and smartness bring a rich attack surface for adversaries. Past research efforts have extensively explored the security aspects of IIoT. Still, none of them took a cryptographic perspective of IIoT security, which is imperative because almost all modern cyber defenses are based on cryptographic primitives. We address this issue in this work. We present a cryptographic perspective of IIoT for the designers and developers. We review the desirable security properties and existing attacks against the IIoT infrastructure. We then review conventional cryptographic tools used to secure modern IIoT networks. Finally, we discuss shortcomings associated with traditional cryptography and recommend Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) techniques that could be integrated with IIoT. Finally, we present future research directions on using cryptography for IIoT environments.}

abstract = {This paper describes a step-by-step approach for generating various energy concepts for neighbourhoods, based on local renewable resources. The approach is developed within the European research project ‘Smart Urban Isle’ (SUI). While much literature is focussed on comparison or optimization of predefined configurations, the SUI approach adds to the existing knowledge by introducing a systematic step-by-step approach that supports the first step of the development phase, i.e., the generation of various - potentially innovative - energy system configurations for neighbourhoods, which in the following phase can be optimized using optimization methods. First, the five steps of the approach are introduced, and secondly, these are applied to an existing residential neighbourhood in the Netherlands. The resulting preferred energy concept for the case study consists of a local, ultra-low temperature heat grid, heated by decentralised heat production from PV-thermal (PVT) collectors on individual roofs and connected to a collective seasonal underground storage (ATES). This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the approach for generating various alternative innovative energy concepts for neighbourhoods, based on the local demands and energy potentials, and also describes the resulting energy concept developed for the case study. This innovative energy concept can also be applied to similar residential neighbourhoods.}

abstract = {Renewable energy resources (RESs) are highly speared to cover colossal electricity demand. Smart microgrids (SMGs) are engaged with demand-side management (DSM) to save more energy and maximize energy efficiency. Voltage and frequency regulations, CO2 emission, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), RES stochastic nature, and load dynamics are still considered the most SMG challenges. New control and management approaches are needed to overcome these challenges. Internet of Things (IoT) is accomplished to provide adaptive monitoring of energy consumption and ensure an economical and secure operation of the SMG. This paper proposes an advanced DSM and control strategy for an efficient energy management system (EMS) in SMG. An optimal cost-effective EMS operation is firstly introduced based on a two-level genetic algorithm (GA) optimization problem and augmented with the time-of-use pricing (ToU) principle. Secondly, the SMG voltage and frequency are optimally regulated using an improved PID-based mixed sensitivity H-infinity (PID-MSH∞) control scheme while operating in islanded mode. The proposed DSM and control strategy harness the immense IoT aptitudes to ensure an economic and secure operation of the SMG. Finally, a SMG lab-scale prototype is experimentally implemented to realize and validate the proposed DSM and control strategy. The experimental results prove the efficacy of the proposed EMS and the effectiveness of the SMG operation. The results confirm the proposed scheme's capability to get an optimal DSM scheme with reducing the SMG energy cost, emission cost, and PAR. The proposed control scheme accomplishes the SMG voltage and frequency regulations in adherence to IEEE Standard-1547 and provides customers' quality of service while customizing voltage for regulating DSM.}

The effect of the NEDC policy on energy efficiency was assessed by integrating the Super Efficiency Epsilon-Based Measure (SE-EBM) model and the Propensity Score Matching Difference-in-Differences (PSM-DID) method, using panel data from 271 cities in China between 2006 and 2020. Initially, the SE-EBM model was utilized to measure energy efficiency. Subsequently, the PSM-DID model was employed to evaluate the effect of the NEDC policy on energy efficiency. The findings revealed that the NEDC policy had significantly enhanced energy efficiency in demonstration cities by approximately 4.8% compared to non-demonstration cities. To ensure the reliability of the results, we conducted five tests and confirmed that the policy effect was significant only after a lag of two periods. It was found that green technology innovation was a key channel for the NEDC policy to improve energy efficiency. This study offers valuable insights into the impact of energy transition policy on energy efficiency and lays a theoretical foundation for designing effective urban energy transition policies.}

The recent circular economy (CE) practices have brought a new shape for the waste management industry, creating value from the generated waste. The shift to a CE represents one of the most significant challenges, particularly in sorting and classifying generated waste. Addressing these challenges would facilitate the recycling industry and helps in promoting remanufacturing. But in the COVID times, most of the generated waste is getting mixed with conventional waste types, especially in the global south. The pandemic has resulted in colossal infectious waste generation. Its handling became the most significant challenge raising fears and concerns over sorting and classifying. Hence, this study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based automated solution for sorting COVID related medical waste streams from other waste types and, at the same time, ensures data-driven decisions for recycling in the context of CE. Metal, paper, glass waste categories, including the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste from the pandemic, are considered. The waste type classification is done based on the image-texture-dependent features, which provided an accurate sorting and classification before the recycling process starts. The features are fused using the proposed decision-level feature fusion scheme. The classification model based on the support vector machine (SVM) classifier performs best (with 96.5 % accuracy, 95.3 % sensitivity, and 95.9 % specificity) in classifying waste types in the context of circular manufacturing and exhibiting the abilities to manage the COVID related medical waste mixed.}

We implemented the proposed framework and we tested its main functionalities in a smart home application scenario. In our experimentation, we investigated three different data patterns, i.e., regular, event-based, and automated, in order to evaluate performance of our framework in terms of response time under different operational conditions. Experimental results show that the latency of the monitoring and service strongly depends on the type of management application running in the system, whereas it is lightly affected by the data patterns.}

abstract = {Increasing population density in cities, and the increasing demand for efficiency in resource usage call for architectures enabling smart cities, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In most such scenarios, the data generated by IoT sensors is not confidential, but its integrity is critical. Data integrity can be achieved by establishing certification mechanisms that provide cryptographic message authentication protocols; however, this requires relatively expensive components for storing and processing the encryption key on the sensor and consumes more power while processing and transmitting data, which leads to the renunciation of security issues in cost sensitive deployments. In this paper, we propose a security solution that provides data integrity without draining the batteries of IoT sensors. Our solution consists of, (i) differentiating legitimate sensors by taking advantage of their impurities formed during the manufacturing process of the transceiver components, and (ii) eliminating the complex components that carry out cryptography as well as the redundant packet header fields, thereby yielding power savings. The testbed implementation of the proposed solution yields power measurement results providing an estimate of 2.52 times improvement in battery life without compromising the integrity of communications in the system, in addition to offering an increase in spectral efficiency and a decrease in the overall IoT device cost.}

abstract = {The bi-directional flow of energy and information in the smart grid makes it possible to record and analyze the electricity consumption profiles of consumers. Because of the increasing rate of inflation over the past few years, people started looking for means to use electricity illegally, termed as electricity theft. Many data analytics techniques are proposed in the literature for electricity theft detection (ETD). These techniques help in the detection of suspected illegal consumers. However, the existing approaches have a low ETD rate either due to improper handling of the imbalanced class problem in a dataset or the selection of inappropriate classifier. In this paper, a robust big data analytics technique is proposed to resolve the aforementioned concerns. Firstly, adaptive synthesis (ADASYN) is applied to handle the imbalanced class problem of data. Secondly convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) integrated deep siamese network (DSN) are proposed to discriminate the features of both honest and fraudulent consumers. Specifically, the task of feature extraction from weekly energy consumption profiles is handed over to the CNN module while the LSTM module performs the sequence learning. Finally, the DSN contemplates on the shared features provided by the CNN-LSTM and applies final judgment. The data analytics is performed on different train–test ratios of the real-time smart meters’ data. The simulation results validate the proposed model’s effectiveness in terms of high area under the curve, F1-Score, precision and recall.}

This paper demonstrates a fiber optic sensor platform that can detect external stimulant events of a smart hydrogel. A tapered resonant fiber sensor was fabricated using arc-induced optical fiber tapering and liquid-based gold coating on the tip of the fiber sensor. Poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm)-based temperature-sensitive hydrogel was selected as a model sensing material. The sensing mechanism employs the volume change of the hydrogel when the external temperature induces the phase transition of the hydrogel. To implement this concept in the proposed fiber sensor, we have developed a reliable approach to create bilayered hydrogel and elastic polymer with the tapered fiber sensor. By embedding the fiber sensor in a thin elastic polymer layer and creating a strong bonding between the hydrogel and the elastic layer through porous elastic polymer interface, the sensor operates reliably over cyclic thermal experiments. The results indicate that our sensor can detect the threshold events of the hydrogel, where its maximum volume changes occur during external temperature changes. We envisage that similar platforms can be extended to other smart hydrogels and their optical sensing applications.}

Research on innovation environments still requires further development. This paper sheds light on fostering and developing innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems in cities from the institutional work perspective, emphasizing the need to institutionalize collaboration. The paper employs the case study method with a process data approach. The study took place in two Latin American cities, Porto Alegre and Florianópolis, within a cultural context characterized by a non-cooperative background. The findings are linked to the institutionalization of collaboration in the development of innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems, unfolding in three phases involving three groups of roles: leaders, supporters, and the community. The practices are associated with the leader's group in the first phase (Preparing for Collaboration). The second phase (Strengthening Collaboration) expands the practices and adjusts the focus to the supporter's group. Additionally, the third phase (Disseminating Collaboration) continues to broaden the scope and gains relevance for the community's group. Therefore, the evolution of the phases is connected to the expansion of the range of institutionalization practices and a focus on the most active roles. These results carry significant implications for the theory and practice of innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem emergence, offering insights into the phases and roles critical for fostering innovation environments. Furthermore, they can provide practical guidance for other cities or regions aiming to cultivate robust innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems.}

abstract = {The increase in development of electric vehicle(EV) will have a strong impact on the power distribution grid if adequate care is not taken on the high power demand required for charging EV. Consequently, there is need to create a platform to enable charging point operators to effectively manage the EV user’s charging requests and ensure that there charging needs are satisfied while not exceeding the distribution grid capacity. If this is not done, there is no doubt that in few a years, EV owners will be faced with the problems of unavailability of charging stations and congestion in grid sequel to simultaneous charging of many EV’s. This work proposes a smart EV charging infrastructure based on a blockchain platform. With the charging demand (kWh) and maximum duration of the charging event provided by the EV user, the EV load flexibility is determined and utilized through smart charging to achieve a stable grid. EV owners and charging stations are linked through the platform thereby reducing the actors in EV charging ecosystem from six to four. Flexibility (power and time) in charging of EV is traded within the blockchain platform. By this, additional investors will be attracted into the business of EV charging station and through flexible offers, EV loads are shifted from the peak load hours. Consequently, the simulations shows that the acceptance rate of EV users increased by more than 50% when our smart charging system was adopted compared to the normal charging scenario.}

abstract = {The electrical energy systems have a large proportion in producing carbon dioxide (CO2). The renewable energy sources (RESs) are the main solutions to decrease the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of these systems to fulfill the sustainable development goals. The photovoltaic (PV) systems make up the largest proportion of the recently installed capacities of the RESs in the world from which the share of the rooftop PVs is increasing especially regarding the development of the smart homes (SHs). Although increasing the rooftop PVs in SHs decreases the pollution emission, it increases the ramp rate of the system's net load as reported by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). To solve this challenge, in this paper, a flexibility-constrained energy management model is proposed for the SHs equipped with rooftop PVs and an electrical energy storage. The flexibility constraint limits the ramp rate of the power trading of the SH with the main grid to increase the flexibility of the power system. To model the uncertain behavior of the energy market price, the energy management problem is modeled as a robust optimization one. The results show the ability of the model to minimize the operation cost of the SH regarding this constraint. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the effect of the flexibility constraint and the robustness parameter on the results.}

Intended to reduce household energy consumption by 5–15%, the SMIP represents the world's largest and most expensive smart meter rollout. However, a series of obstacles and delays has restricted implementation. To explore why, this study investigates the socio-technical challenges facing the SMIP, with a strong emphasis on the “social” side of the equation. It explains its two primary sources of data, a systematic review of the academic literature coupled with observation of seven major SMIP events. It offers a history of the SMIP rollout, including a summary of 67 potential benefits as well as often-discussed technical challenges, before delving into pertinent non-technical challenges, specifically vulnerability as well as consumer resistance and ambivalence. In doing so, the paper not only presents a critique of SMIP, it also offers a review of academic studies on consumer responses to smart meters, an analysis of the intersection between smart meters and other social concerns such as poverty or the marginalization of rural areas, and the generation of policy lessons.}

abstract = {Chillers are responsible for almost half of the total energy demand in buildings. Hence, the obligation of control systems of multi-chiller due to changes indoor environments is one of the most significant parts of a smart building. Such a controller is described as a nonlinear and multi-objective algorithm, and its fabrication is crucial to achieving the optimal balance between indoor thermal comfort and running a minimum number of chillers. This work proposes deep clustering of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (DCCMARL) as well-suited to such system control, which supports centralized control by learning of agents. In MARL, since the learning of agents is based on discrete sets of actions and stats, this drawback significantly affects the model of agents for representing their actions with efficient performance. This drawback becomes considerably worse when increasing the number of agents, due to the increased complexity of solving MARL, which makes modeling policy very challenging. Therefore, the DCCMARL of multi-objective reinforcement learning is leveraging powerful frameworks of a hybrid clustering algorithm to deal with complexity and uncertainty, which is a critical factor that influences to the achievement of high levels of a performance action. The results showed that the ability of agents to manipulate the behavior of the smart building could improve indoor thermal conditions, as well as save energy up to 44.5% compared to conventional methods. It seems reasonable to conclude that agents' performance is influenced by what type of model structure.}

Recently, wearable finger-type PPG devices are increasingly developed toward convenience of person under monitoring (PUM). Two most critical features of wearable PPG devices are high accuracy and long operation time. To enhance these functions, this paper proposes a new architecture to select, process and transfer only high quality PPG signals. Hence, data quality is significantly improved and power consumption on wireless module is minimized. In the proposed architecture, parameters of PPG sensor are reconfigured in real-time being suitable with skin characteristics of PUM. Moreover, the adaptive LED current control algorithm is proposed to dynamically change the LED current to remove various motion artifacts (MA) and get high amplitude PPG signal. We also develop a heart rate (HR) estimation framework utilizing deep learning (DL) model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The combination of CNN-LSTM can extract features from both spatial and temporal correlation. A light-weight model with two CNN-LSTM layers is built to estimate HR with in only 5s. For validation, we conduct experiments with volunteers doing various physical exercises. The results show PPG signals with high amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). HR estimation is more accurate even during irregular and muscle strength exercises. The proposed adaptive architecture and DL-based HR estimation can overcome MA and minimize the power consumption on wireless transfer module of wearable PPG devices.}

Origin–destination (O–D) estimation has been recognized as a requisite step before utilizing the smart card data to investigate transit passengers’ spatiotemporal dynamics or conduct other SC data-based transit modeling. In the recent decade, the extant literature has proposed various trip-chain-based methods for transit O-D estimation using SC data. However, one problem of the conventional trip-chaining estimation approach has been noticed but not paid enough attention to: O-D estimation of single transactions cannot be conducted since the trip-chain method generally requires at least two trip records per day to proceed with. Such a flaw in the classic trip-chain approach might lead to a considerable amount of data loss and inaccurate O-D estimation. This paper improved the existing trip-chain O-D estimation method by introducing a new framework based on the Minimum Entropy Rate (MER) criterion. The proposed MER-based method adopts a similar mechanism of noise reduction in information theory. The basic idea of our approach is to infer the alighting location of single trips using alternative stops that preserve passengers’ travel regularity exhibiting in their mobility sequences. Our enhanced approach can estimate alighting stops for single trips with decent accuracy, thus preventing a potential massive data loss. Moreover, the study also provides an in-depth insight into the relationship between entropy rates estimated using trip sequences and passengers’ travel regularity. The estimation results can further benefit future transit studies with reliable data sources.}

abstract = {The production of electrical energy is always a substantial contributor to a country's economy; in particular, integrating renewable energy sources into the existing power system has tremendous techno-economic implications. However, the optimal penetration of renewables and dynamic loads management is highly complex while considering the multiple variables, time-varying characteristics, and operational uncertainties. This paper proposes a new model design of a grid-tied renewable system. It investigates energy economics and forecasts for the practical locality of the Muzaffarabad area in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The proposed research examines the annualized energy estimation concerning varied customer PV system participation. The impact of consumer feedback on energy production is briefly examined. Various aspects, such as energy economics, including annual revenue generation, energy prices, and energy sell-back, are demonstrated in detail. The proposed study also looks at the connection between the rising usage of renewable energy and falling greenhouse gas emissions and energy prices. Moreover, it shows how customer input has altered energy economics via each district taking part in energy sharing. Also, it illustrates the relationship between energy bought and sold and how the grid and PV's share of energy interact. Based on the research study findings, PV systems can provide 61% of the total region's energy needs with maximum consumer involvement. The study found that when PV is integrated at a maximum level, grid energy purchases fall to 52%. Polluting gas emissions were reduced by 64% courtesy of the recommended approach, and energy cost was cut from $0.20 per kWh to $0.09 per kWh. The recommended system produces 81,635,608 dollars in revenue yearly and achieves a renewable part of 46.17% with the highest level of customer interaction.}

However, the energy efficiency and livability of a city are affected by not only these technological factors but also urban structures that encompass residential areas, offices, transportation networks, and other facilities. Urban policies intervene in transportation and land-use conditions and thereby change how citizens consume energy and go about their daily lives as the actors in the urban system alter their behavior. This means that energy efficiency and quality of life share close ties. Assessments of urban policies thus need to consider the reactions of actors to the intervention. This study demonstrates the applicability of a land-use transport model to the assessment of urban policies for building smart communities. First, we outline a model that explicitly formulates the actors' location-related decisions and travel behavior. Second, we apply this model to two urban policies – road pricing and land-use regulation – to assess their long-term impact on energy saving and sustainability using the case of a simplified synthetic city. Our study verifies that, under assumed conditions, the model has the capacity to assess urban policies on energy use and sustainability in a consistent fashion.}

An affordable and scalable wireless communication technology is proposed to aggregate geographically sparse DERs into a single virtual power plant (VPP). An ant colony optimization (ACO) method is used for the first time to the best of our knowledge in conjunction with geographic greedy forwarding protocol to effectively deliver data packets without void problems for VPP. The VPP investigated is dynamic and expected to scale up as more and more prosumers are attracted to join it. The proposed communication network and protocol follow the progression of the VPP to allow scalability and rapid deployment.

abstract = {In this research study, a novel demand response program (DRP) has been proposed for renewable-based microgrids (MGs) which takes into account the high penetration of tidal units and solar energy as important, prevalent renewable resources in the power systems. To this end, multi-objective problem (MOP) structure is a promising solution to reduce the whole operating costs of the scheduling problem as well as decrease the high risk of failure in electrical power transmission because of component increasing failure rates and extended repair time. The complexities and nonlinearity of the problem necessitate an innovative heuristic solution which is derived from the Grey Wolf optimization algorithm to help for resolving the problem without making any assumptions or compromising precision. This paper also proposes the dynamic 3-phase correction (DPC) formulation to boost the layout convergence ability by increasing the global search features. Through such a modification, the diversity of the members in the algorithm population increases which would result in low computational burden and low possibility of trapping in local optima. Moreover, it is necessary to have a clear and accurate estimation of the output power of renewable sources in the system. Considering that solar irradiance is hard to anticipate, this paper develops a deep learning layout that uses generative adversarial networks (GAN) to forecast the hourly power generation of the tidal and solar agents. GAN model consists of two competing networks which help to enhance the training process by increasing the accuracy of distinguishing real data from fake data. At the end, IEEE standard test system is used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the suggested multi-layer problem. The simulation results display that the suggested deep model outperforms other well-known algorithms in smart microgrids.}

After pursuing rigorous prophylactic measures two years ago, most activities globally reopened despite the emergence of lethal genetic strains.

Hence, our research question is: How can the potential hotspots of COVID-19 risk be defined intra-cities based on the spatial planning of commercial activity in particular?

First, we analyzed each activity's spatial and morphological characteristics and potential infection risk based on the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) criteria and the Kriging Interpolation method. Then, using Google Mobility, previous reports, and semi-structured interviews, points of interest and population flow were defined and combined with the last step as interrelated horizontal layers for determining hotspots. A validation study compared the generated activity risk map, spatial COVID-19 cases, and land use distribution using logistic regression (LR) and Pearson coefficients (rxy). Through visual analytics, our findings indicate the central areas of both cities, including incompatible and concentrated commercial activities, have high-risk peaks (LR = 0.903, rxy = 0.78) despite the medium urban density of districts, indicating that urban density alone is insufficient for public health risk reduction. Health perspective-based spatial configuration of activities is advised as a risk assessment tool along with urban density for appropriate decision-making in shaping pandemic-resilient cities.}

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an innovative technology that is considered as an opportunity for the AEC industry to move to the digital era and improve the collaboration among stakeholders by applying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). BIM provides all required tools and automations to achieve end-to-end communication, data exchange and information sharing among collaborators. Accordingly, virtual 3D models, created by the BIM process, delivered as physical assets, monitored in real-time and managed using Building Management Systems (BMS), can adopt the Internet of Things (IoT) designs and services. However, the implementation of IoT in a highly modular environment with various moving parts and inter-dependencies between stakeholders leads to security concerns. Therefore, this paper proposes system design that employs the blockchain technology as a measure to secure and control the framework that involves integrated IoT and BIM technologies. Although this paper considers system design applied in a smart museum, the authors assume that design is generic and applicable in other building categories. For instance, this design can be implemented in the ongoing Alumni Hall renovation project at State University of New York College at Oneonta.}

SGs require new policies and market infrastructures to deliver their potential, but the roles of governments in increasingly market based energy systems have not been well conceptualised. Advancing the socio-technical energy transitions literature, this paper proposes five functions of government-market dynamics in an integrated framework, and applies the framework in the field of smart grid developments in two Asian countries, China and Japan. Based on interviews with 38 key stakeholders, this study has three main findings. First, both countries have in common that the five functions of government-market dynamics are critical in developing, diffusing and utilising SG technologies. Second, China and Japan exhibit distinctive characteristics in the ways that government actors engage market actors. While the Chinese approach is more hierarchical, fragmented and homogenous led by two monopolised grid companies, the Japanese approach is a relatively systemic, bottom-up, and heterogeneous system mainly operated through four large-scale SG demonstration projects. Third, national contextual differences, most notably the advancement of electricity market reforms, explain the variety of the dynamics and outcomes. This paper concludes that consideration of optimising government-market dynamics is vital to create conductive conditions for realising the potential that SGs can offer in energy transitions.}

The domain researchers have attempted to understand the attributes of a meaningful and effective collaboration with citizens and improve the quality of engagement accordingly. With this aim, a rich and extensive literature has been created, covering different aspects of citizen engagement. The subjective-ness and context-sensitivity of involved issues, however, do not allow for a ‘universal’ standard solution to be proposed, even to a similar problem, in different spatiotemporal contexts. In this paper, after an extensive analysis of a broadly inclusive range of existing literature through more than 1092 publications, a conceptual framework is proposed to contextualize citizen engagement in urban projects. Using this framework, a model is trained, with the aid of the fuzzy paradigm to provide fuzzy sets of most relevant keywords for a query regarding citizen engagement in urban projects, and a decision support system is developed to retrieve the most relevant publications, based on the fuzzy inference mechanism. The system provides the most relevant keywords for reviewing the literature, as well as the most related documents, through answering a set of simple questions. The solution is deployed through a user interface, linked to the well-known Elsevier online database Scopus. The developed system can assist researchers and practitioners with retrieving knowledge from the literature, for setting up new projects.}

abstract = {We are still challenged to fully understand to what extent controlling irrigation inputs is important for limiting phosphorus (P) losses from paddy soils and how this affects the contribution of dissolved P (DP), particulate P (PP), and colloidal P (Pcoll) fractions in P losses. For this investigation, an internet-based smart irrigation system was developed to precisely implement different irrigation scenarios––flooding irrigation (FI) and two water-saving irrigation (WSI) scenarios of intermittent (II) and controlled irrigation (CI). A simulation experiment was conducted and the concentrations of total P (TP), DP, PP, and Pcoll released to floodwater (FW) and leachate (LW) were determined during a rice season after the addition of different P forms (chemical fertilizer (CP), biogas slurry (BP), and manure (MP)) at a rate of 40 kg P·ha−1. The results revealed that the CI scenario effectively decreased P losses in FW (∼51%) and LW (∼63%) with a positive WSI ratio (39.1%), while II reduced it in FW by ∼11% and in LW by ∼27% with a WSI ratio of 11.0% compared with FI. The BP and MP additions caused a higher risk of P losses than CP under FI, with lower risk under WSI. DP largely contributed to P losses (FW: 30%–71%; LW: 42%–66%); however, more PP was released to FW under II (37%–54% of TP). The Pcoll (FW: 5%–23% and LW: 6%–24%) was more sensitive to release at initial periods after fertilization on account PP. This work provides a promising approach to timely control irrigation inputs, which could limit P losses from paddy soil; however, there remains a need to assess and generalize our initial evidence at field scales.}

The incorporation of smart cities with the Internet has given us the Next Generation of Internet (NGI) where every smart device exploits the interconnected services and infrastructure of the Internet. The underlying structure of NGI is composed of large scale heterogeneous multilevel systems-of-systems (SoSs) where each system represents a sensor, mobile phone, computer or smart device. Security and privacy is a fundamental requirement of NGI which is heavily dependent on the composition of services and connectivity of the underlying systems. Meaning any unsecure system can affect the security of the entire networked infrastructure/SoSs. Therefore, it is important to analyse and understand the composition of different systems at different levels in NGI in order to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a solution to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within multilevel SoSs, to enhance security without deploying additional security at endpoints, and quantify security levels of individual systems and the entire composed system. The solution was tested and evaluated using simulation and a network testbed. Results show that NGI security can be enhanced with better composition of systems.}

abstract = {Owing to the development of industrial internet of things (IIoT) technology, the connectivity and complexity of vehicles have also increased, and new communication technologies have been introduced to in-vehicle networks (IVN). In order to achieve a sufficient level of IIoT cybersecurity, strict ground rules must exist in the critical infrastructures (CI). Traditionally, many legacy communication techniques such as controller area networks (CAN), and FlexRay have been proposed and used for IVN and CI. However, these legacy protocols cannot accommodate advanced IIoT technologies that require high connectivity; hence, Ethernet for vehicles has been introduced in recent years. The phenomenon of introducing Ethernet to IVN is an irreversible industrial trend, such as Ethernet-based Smart Factory, Smart City, and industrial control system based on IIoT. Some automotive Ethernet protocols such as MOST150 and BroadR-Reach have been commercialized primarily for infotainment and are being expanded for providing IIoT services. However, security studies pertaining to automotive Ethernet are incomplete. Even though the amount of data that must be processed by security solutions in the Ethernet environment is increasing, vehicles must be guaranteed ‘hard real-time’. In this study, to reflect the characteristics of IVN security such as real-time, extensibility, and certainty, we establish an IVN simulation environment based on several Ethernet protocols and propose an automatic whitelist generation system. The whitelist performs filtering based on certain criteria, and after it is defined, the time consumed for packet preprocessing is extremely small. The proposed system is designed to create a whitelist through learning to ensure extensibility in an IVN environment composed of heterogeneous networks. The proposed system operates in two stages: the first step automatically generates three types of whitelists, i.e., global, local, and connection, by learning the network; the second step performs filtering by applying the generated rule. The whitelists generated through the proposed system filter out abnormal packets or sections based on the alert levels. The proposed system is expected to cope flexibly with various potential cyber threats on IVNs in the future.}

The smart trash bin takes Arduino as its master controller and interacts with Arduino in the WiFi environment to realize automatic garbage classification and communication between people and trash bin. This paper aims to describe the hardware and software design ideas of trash bins in the implementation process, and the mechanism of garbage classification and the application of the Internet of things in garbage recycling are emphatically studied. The results indicate that the system can run stably and achieve accurate classification within 2seconds, which reduces the waste of resources, changes the traditional garbage management mode, improves management efficiency, and realizes recycling of garbage.}

The analysis suggests that while non-governmental actors are included in many networks, their opportunities for effective participation are limited in comparison with local policymakers. Additionally an improved cooperation and alignment between trans-local city food networks would avoid duplication of efforts. By reflecting on their own approach trans-local city food networks could actively look for other networks that can reinforce or complement their own work.}

Thus, the innovations of this study includes defining an energy exchange method between smart buildings in an off-grid mode considering renewable energy systems, considering both thermal and electrical equilibrium and studying the lightning loads. it is assumed, here, that smart homes are off-grid‘ and the critical loads are supplied by the energy transfer between the homes using mixed integer linear programming. A compromise between the cost and time interval for using home appliances is considered to provide consumer’s comfort. An objective function is introduced considering programmable and non-programmable loads‘ thermal and electrical storages and lighting loads aiming to optimize the cost of energy between different smart buildings. Based on the method, which is tested in two different cases not only does the total cost of the smart buildings decrease but also the cost is reduced significantly when lightning loads are managed.}

These novel strategies aim to impact selected customers with a specific range of heat consumption intensity to assess achievable flexibilities in heating demand without additional cost. The results show that a reduction in DHN supplied temperature by 6 °C does not significantly influence the heat consumption of customers equipped with radiators and thermostatic valves. However, its reduction by 10 °C, and 20 °C can impact users with higher consumed heat rates of approximately 0.2 and 0.1 [Unit/10min], respectively. Moreover, prolonging test periods until midday, when there is the highest probable outdoor temperature and solar irradiation may avoid sharp energy variations after tests.}

abstract = {Smart product-service system (PSS) has been transcending scope of traditional PSS and can be characterized as value co-creation business strategy. This article aims to propose a framework with hybrid approach to capture and evaluate conceptual factors of smart PSS in fuzzy front end. According to service logic that is one of value co-creation paradigms, conceptual factors can be divided into customer needs (CNs) as customer problems to be solved, co-creative value propositions (CVPs) as mutual benefits and system requirements (SRs) as abstract solutions, which just match with three spheres of customer, joint and provider in service logic, respectively. Particularly, CVPs on smart PSS are captured from various interactions in its sequence diagram. As means-end chain theory, three types of conceptual factors for smart PSS are formed into multi-hierarchy network structure, and they are evaluated through a hybrid approach integrating fuzzy DEMATEL, modified-ANP and fuzzy TOPSIS. As a result, SRs prioritization is derived to give support to conceptual design of smart PSS. Sensitivity analysis also is conducted to test reliability of SRs prioritization. Finally, an illustrative case study of smart fridge-service system (SFSS) is demonstrated along this proposed methodological framework.}

abstract = {Islands are highly diverse in their climatic, physical, social, and economic characteristics. Thus, each island’s energy system needs to be designed according to its specific features. However, similarities among islands exist which can enable the fast transfer of concepts and experiences with energy systems. In the Philippines, only few off-grid islands are incorporating smart energy systems through hybrid electricity systems. While most off-grid islands still do not have access to electricity, the majority of off-grid Philippine islands having access to electricity are powered primarily by diesel-fired generators. In this work, a cluster analysis is performed for 502 off-grid islands in the Philippine archipelago, classifying the islands according to their similarities in socio-economic and physical characteristics, and indigenous energy resource potential. The results show that most of the islands belong to five clusters of very small and small islands for which photovoltaic-battery systems would be the favourable backbone of a future energy system based on renewable energies. These islands show a varying level of feasibility for harnessing wind energy. In medium and big islands, opportunities of linking electricity systems to water supply and thermal energy loads as well as to the transport sector, are identified and their relevance in the clusters is discussed. The results are consistent with the validation of the individual characteristics of chosen off-grid islands. The cluster analysis results support policy makers and private investors in deciding which smart energy system projects are suitable for which particular islands.}

This paper presents a simulation study on the role of DSM in the peak load management for a residential community. Here, load shitting-based DSM technique is used. This study considered the daily consumption patterns (hour wise) of electricity using the four types of electric loads. Results showed a considerable decrease in the peak load when compared to the load patterns before applying DSM. The average demand per day in summer is 4.521 kW, and in winter is 3.871 kW. The summary of peak load demands per day in kW without DSM are 14.712 kW, and 18.18 kW for summer and winter respectively. With the load shifting based DSM technique, the peak load per day are reduced to 9.6 kW in the summer season and 9.672 kW in the winter season.}

Objective: We introduce Euphoria, a new software architecture design and implementation that enables easy prototyping, deployment, and evaluation of adaptable and flexible interactions across heterogeneous devices in smart environments. Method: We designed Euphoria by following the requirements of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard on Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation applied to the specific context of smart environments. Results: To demonstrate the adaptability and flexibility of Euphoria, we describe three application scenarios for contexts of use involving multiple users, multiple input/output devices, and various types of smart environments, as follows: (1) wearable user interfaces and whole-body gesture input for interacting with public ambient displays, (2) multi-device interactions in physical-digital spaces, and (3) interactions on smartwatches for a connected car application scenario. We also perform a technical evaluation of Euphoria regarding the main factors responsible for the magnitudes of the request-response times for producing, broadcasting, and consuming messages inside the architecture. We deliver the source code of Euphoria free to download and use for research purposes. Conclusion: By introducing Euphoria and discussing its applicability, we hope to foster advances and developments in new software architecture initiatives for our increasingly complex smart environments, but also to readily support implementations of novel interactive systems and applications for smart environments of all kinds.}

abstract = {The development of new concepts for a public transport is motivated by reducing environmental pollution and traffic jams in city areas. Another essential reason for energy efficient vehicle concepts is to reduce transportation costs. Accordingly, a design and production of environmental friendly and emission free vehicles for urban public transportation is an important research and technological task. The architecture of a serial hybrid bus has the big capability to achieve above-mentioned aims because such vehicles have two energy sources (more degree of freedom) and more than one energy storage unit (battery, air tanks of vehicle pneumatic system). Thus, there is a big potential for the development of predictive control algorithms for various systems to enhance the overall energy efficiency and driving performance of such type of public transport. Today the control algorithms of different systems in hybrid electric vehicles are implemented often as the kind of open-loop control. A typical example is the control strategy of vehicle air compressor. Currently, this unit of vehicle pneumatic system is operated by the principle of two-point controller regardless of the vehicle driving status and location on a route, the traffic situation and battery state, the number of passengers etc. Taking into account modern networking technologies it is possible to achieve a higher level of vehicle systems control with the aim to enhance the overall energy efficiency of vehicle operation. The goal is to develop vehicles on various types of closed-loop control systems (e.g. battery state of charge depending on system- and route parameters) towards smart vehicles (interconnection with the environment, additional history data, prediction etc.). Authors focus on the development of closed-loop control strategy for the air compressor in a serial hybrid bus, as a first step, to improve the energy efficiency of compressor operation. Furthermore, the paper discusses how to increase the overall efficiency of vehicles including already implemented networking technologies.}

Meanwhile, the growing demand for charging power, and the stochastic patterns of charging behaviors are creating the scarcity of electricity and significant power fluctuations to the power system. To ensure the system stability and the supply–demand balance of the electricity market, several technical measures are necessary, such as more ancillary power reserve, appropriate demand-side energy management, etc. Moreover, the higher penetration level of renewable energy sources in the conventional power system can be leveraged to sustain the power peak induced by the charging demand with proper system operation strategies. This paper presents an overview of the latest research of EV charging stations and highlights some important issues and challenges in power architectures design, energy storage techniques, control strategies of micro-grid, and energy management optimization. In addition, the hierarchical control system is specifically outlined, which offers decoupled control objectives in different layers of microgrid systems for EV charging. Typical coordinated control techniques and energy management strategies aiming to achieve the optimum performance of EV charging stations are investigated in detail. Further, the future research directions are extensively discussed at the end of this paper.}

The design which is termed “Smart Channels” decreases the angle of the channelized right-turn to approximately 70°. Its implementation is usually advocated to afford drivers a better view of the traffic stream they are to merge with and to allow also for safer pedestrian crossing. The evaluation used data for three treatment intersections and several comparison sites in the city of Penticton, British Columbia. The evaluation utilized FB univariate and multivariate linear intervention models with multiple regression links representing time, treatment, and interaction effects as well as the traffic volumes effects. As well, the models were extended to incorporate random parameters to account for the correlation between sites within comparison-treatment pairs. The results showed that the implementation of the right-turn treatment has resulted in a considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of collisions. Another objective of the paper was to compare the results of the collision-based evaluation with the results of a traffic conflict-based evaluation of the same treatment intersections. The comparison showed remarkable similarity between the overall and the location specific reductions in conflicts and collisions which provides support for using traffic conflicts in BA studies. The results also provide positive empirical evidence that can support the validity of traffic conflict techniques.}

Various neighbourhood planning concepts have been developed following smart growth principles such as transit oriented development, and infill development. Existing empirical studies, however, do not answer to a key policy question: can smart growth policies reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect? If so, what type of smart growth policy would be most effective? This research examined the questions by deriving five alternative neighbourhood planning scenarios for Brisbane for 2023: a) business as usual, b) transit oriented development (TOD), c) infill development, d) motorway corridor oriented development, and e) sprawl development. The research utilises Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to: first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population density, and porosity. Results show that compared to the 2004 and 2013 levels, Brisbane will respectively experience a higher and lower levels of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios. On average, the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in 2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario.}

Broad participation of customers in these programs may lead to a peak rebound and the distribution system congestion in lower load periods, endangering the supply of reliable and sustainable electricity to urban consumers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a reward-penalty DRP for customers in smart distribution networks. In the proposed program, the customers receive rewards as they reduce or shift their demands in requested hours. The customers may also be penalized if their demands exceed predefined thresholds. An optimization problem is proposed to determine the optimal penalty and reward values. The objective function is to maximize the distribution company's profit, considering operational constraints of the distribution system. The proposed program is examined on a test system, and the results are compared with the broad application of conventional incentive-based DRPs. The results indicate that the proposed reward-penalty DRP can improve the network operational characteristics and mitigate the peak rebound, without imposing more costs on customers.}

Demands are predicted using lagged demand, seasonality, weather, and household characteristics. Time-series clustering is applied to delineate data based on the time of day and day of the week, which improves model performance. Two modeling approaches are compared. Individual models are developed separately for each meter, and a Group model is trained using a data set of multiple meters. Individual models predict demands at meters in the original data set with lower error than Group models, while the Group model predicts demands at new meters with lower error than Individual models. Results demonstrate that RF and ANN perform better than SVR across all scenarios.}

abstract = {Fog computing has become a new cutting-edge technology to bring cloud applications closer to physical IoT devices at the edge of the network. In Fog computing use case scenarios latency is the main challenge that must be addressed since mission-critical environments are mostly delay sensitive. To achieve this goal, the fog nodes placement is needed to minimize the delays in the service access layer. There is neither a common fog computing architecture nor a generally accepted concept of fog nodes, how and where to deploy fog nodes or how it supports the real-time Internet of Things (IoT) service execution. Edge devices such as the switch, router, gateway, mobile phones, smart car etc., are the candidates for deployment of fog nodes but the deployment differs according to the application. In this work, we have taken gateways as candidates for fog node deployment. The gateway collects data from smart sensors, but it does not have any pre-processing or decision-making capabilities. Therefore, the gateway is made smarter with Fog capabilities and named as Fog Smart Gateway (FSG). The processing of IoT traffic is taken care of by Virtual Machines (VMs) facilitated by distributed Fog nodes. We optimized the number of fog nodes for deployment to reduce the total latency induced by traffic aggregation and processing. Our results show that the optimal deployment of fog nodes in the IoT network could yield a reduction in latency compared to processing IoT data in a conventional cloud system.}

We suggest using this information, in the form of a price index, to forecast the occupation rates for virtually any time-space frame, provided that there are a sufficient number of decision makers “sharing” their pricing strategies on the web. Our approach guarantees great transparency and replicability, as big data from OTAs do not depend on search interfaces and can facilitate intelligent interactions between the territory and its inhabitants, thus providing a starting point for a smart decision-making process. We show that it is possible to obtain a noticeable increase in the forecasting performance by including the proposed leading indicator (price index) into the set of explanatory variables, even with very simple model specifications. Our findings offer a new research direction in the field of tourism demand forecasting leveraging on big data from the supply side.}

The city saw its periods of growth and decline from being an important cultural, religious, economic and political centre to mere a war site. It was rebuilt during the colonial period and within a century, grew from a swampy settlement of 12,000 people (1911) into a vast urban agglomeration of nearly 1.26 million population (2011). Today, while this ancient “City of Eastern Light” has regained its importance as an urban centre, intense growth has led to physical, social and environmental vulnerabilities regardless of numerous planned efforts engaged in city building including adoption of city Master Plans since 1960s. Despite this, Guwahati has been the focus of little research in terms of its morphology depicting both, historic planning paradigms and modern urban visioning to reflect the city's ongoing story. Based on secondary data, this city profile, narrates the growth and morphological evolution of Guwahati from mythology to modern period. It then critically examines the city in its present form and concludes that a convergence between emergence and planning may be a necessary renaissance for Guwahati as it seeks to transform itself into one of the most admired, smart and sustainable cities in India. The theoretical narration is supported with strong visual atlas which provides an empirical strength to this profile.}

abstract = {On-line understanding human activities can contribute solutions to some problems existing in the smart-city schema such as health-care, urban mobility, or security. Wearable sensors, especially sensors embedded in smartphones, turn to be good data streams for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are evaluated on small and fixed-size datasets, and lack of data sharing as well as classifiers re-training functions. These issues will lead to the challenge of unadaptable learning when facing problems of volume and variety of data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new method with adaptive, interactive, and general-personal-model training components, and data sharing on the cloud. The major advantage of the proposed method is very fast to detect human activities of a new user at the beginning (i.e. deploying a system to a new user) with an acceptable accuracy of detection using the general model. Then, the personal model will help to increase the accuracy of activities detection personally by interacting with users. Another advantage of the proposed method is to share data (e.g. sensory data, models, activities, and user’s profiles) among users/apps joined the system. These data will help to increase the accuracy of models timely by re-training periodically. Besides, the method can be used as a human-activity sensor that streams detected human activities to related components of smart-city scheme. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to de-facto datasets as well as state-of-the-art of HAR using smartphones. The experimental results show that there is a significant improvement of HAR’s accuracy when utilizing the proposed method.}

abstract = {Objective
The present study aims to: 1) determine whether the risks associated with distracted walking are influenced by walking environment by estimating the incidence and severity of phone-related distracted walking injuries; and 2) investigate individuals’ perceptions of distracted walking risk within different walking environments to understand whether individuals are aware of the potential risks and the manner in which they understand those risks.
Background
Distracted walking has been increasingly considered a public safety issue over the past few years. Research has focused on understanding the many factors that may influence pedestrians’ engagement with smart-devices in order to address this issue. Risk perception may be one factor that guides engagement decisions but has not been widely studied in the context of distracted walking. Risk perception and the consequences of distracted walking are likely to be impacted by the walking environment, however, current research has typically focused on a subset of locations— streets and intersections.
Method
This study used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a national database of injuries due to consumer products, to understand the number and severity of distracted walking injuries and locations where it occurred. Phone related injury cases from 2011 to 2019 were extracted and categorized by two independent raters in terms of cause of injury and location of injury. An online questionnaire, N = 207, was used to understand how individuals’ perception of risk in five different walking environments (intersections, stairwells, hallways, pedestrian plazas, and parking lots) were related to distraction engagement. Risk perception was measured through three different framings: risk of distracted walking (i.e., overall risk of engaging with the behavior), risk of collision and risk of falls (e.g., risks associated with the consequences of engaging with the behavior).
Results
The NEISS analysis showed an upward trend of distracted walking injuries from 2011 (2184 incidents) to 2019 (4711 incidents) and that the number of injuries differed across the different walking environments. The survey results showed that individuals varied their risk perception levels (risk of distracted walking, collision, and falls) based on the walking environment and distraction status (distraction and no distraction). The relationship between overall risk of distracted walking and the risks of the different consequences (falls & collision) differed by walking environment. Finally, significant negative correlations were found between risk perception and actual distraction engagement for each location.}

abstract = {A recursive logit model is proposed for path choice modeling with transit smart card data in higher-frequency bus and rail services. In such circumstances, it is commonly assumed that passengers may arrive randomly to a stop and may behave according to a “strategy”; such a strategy is associated with a so-called “attractive” set of routes: a passenger selects a set of routes departing from the stop, and will board the next vehicle to depart from among that set of routes. We extend the conventional notion of attractive sets by introducing a measure of “attractiveness” that allows for randomness in the choice of attractive routes. The proposed model uses a link-based (recursive, or sequential choice) formulation, rather than a path-based formulation, which has the advantage of including all path alternatives without the need for path set enumeration. The recursive formulation is also very suitable for smart card data because it allows model calibration with incomplete path choice observations. The link-based approach was originally advocated by Nguyen et al. (1988) in the strategy-based transit assignment context, but without investigating methods for model calibration or empirical analysis. Recently, Fosgerau et al. (2013) and Mai et al. (2015) have presented methods to empirically estimate traffic path choice models using a link-based formulation. Our framework builds off these previous works to formulate and estimate a strategy-based path choice model with smart card data. The proposed model is tested with a 6 months extract from the smart card transactions in Brisbane, Australia, for two popular origin-destination pairs with diverse path alternatives.}

The emergence of ubiquitous sensors, smart devices and broad-band Internet capacity has enabled the integration of networks for synchronous data collecting and processing, which ultimately facilitates prompt decision-making and physical responses to changes in a real-time manner. The virtual interconnectedness of humans and objects exerts managerial efficiency and emotional comfort for network operators, end users and other third party actors, which results in the embrace of IoT-based platforms in production and consumption. The skyrocketing urbanization has chronically caused dense concentration of population in buildings, which yields market prospects for smart-building management system solutions based on IoT applications. Nevertheless, IoT application business models have remained nascent in emerging and transitional economies. In this paper, the authors exploit the Business Model Canvas to assess an IoT start-up in Vietnam and to establish an output Business Model Canvas for entrepreneurs.

Using longitudinal register data geocoded at a 100-meter level and encompassing the entire population and workplaces, we track the 200 largest Swedish cities over a 25-year period (1992–2017). The 15-minute city is operationalized as the proportion of the population in each city that can access a range of non-work urban social functions within a short distance from home. The study uses various multivariate modeling techniques, including fixed effect models, to measure the effects of changes in the built environment. We thus address significant research gaps by investigating the dynamic nature of the 15-minute city concept, conducting comparisons within and across multiple cities, and considering the influence of the built environment, particularly in smaller cities. Results show that population size has less significance than expected, and that smaller cities can achieve certain criteria of the 15-minute city. However, increasing population density and promoting mixed land use clearly contribute to fostering the 15-minute city. Moreover, cities that to a larger extent were developed before mass motorization tend to exhibit a greater degree of 15-minute city characteristics. The results highlight the importance of making long-term, thoughtful, strategic decisions in urban planning efforts aimed at transforming cities into 15-minute cities.}

This paper analyzes how the investment costs of the different smart grid applications installed by network operators can be recovered in the short-term when a locational marginal pricing scheme is applied. This issue has been previously addressed in literature with simple economic models where the multilevel structure of the smart grid is not considered. As a key contribution, this paper presents a new social welfare optimization model considering implementation strategies with different expenditure levels in smart grid technologies where specific applications as renewable distributed generation, network automation, demand–response and reactive power management are explicitly considered. The proposed model has been implemented using a 3-node illustrative example and a 149000-node network under real-world conditions. Results show how a progressive implementation of smart grid applications can produce increased system efficiency and social welfare, in particular when demand–response is enabled. Results also show how the costs of demand–response applications applied in weak power systems are suitable to be recovered in the short-term with marginal revenues of the network provider.}

In particular, digital public participatory GIS (PPGIS) presents a tool for combining technological approaches to urban planning with an agenda for more just nature-based solutions (NBS) by elucidating community voices and subjective perspectives. In this study, we investigate the potential for PPGIS to support more just and inclusive planning and implementation of NBS in a marginalized housing area (Hørgården) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Combining digital PPGIS with qualitative approaches, we identify residents’ meaningful places, narratives about community priorities and needs, and relational values expressed therein. We identify three key findings: (1) an absence of demographic difference in meaningful places identified in Hørgården; (2) a core-periphery structure in the presence of relational value and distribution of sites identified as unsafe or in need of care that is the inverse of that found in Danish policy discourse, and (3) the essential role of qualitative, community-engaged, and reflexive approaches to PPGIS in deriving these results. Based on these findings we conclude that smart technologies like digital PPGIS, framed within systems-based approaches and utilized in locally sensitive and responsive ways, can contribute to more just NBS for sustainable cities by connecting local neighborhood experience to municipal planning and policy agendas.}

abstract = {The smart grid ensures greater robustness, efficiency, reliability and flexibility. Very long, old and poorly planned Low Voltage Distribution System (LVDS) of India is the major reason behind the high Aggregated Technical and Commercial (AT&C) loss, inferior power quality and low reliability besides consumer dissatisfaction. Review of smart grid policy framework of India indicated that the upgradation of LVDS to High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS), retrofitting of conventional Aluminum conductor steel-reinforced (ACSR) to Aerial Bunched Cables (ABC) are mainly considered under the initial phase of Indian grid modernization program. The impact of different AT&C loss reduction measures considered in country and state level grid modernization polices are evaluated using real-world operational data to analyze the actual benefits derived from the implementation of policy measures. The prediction error between the actual benefits achieved and the benefits forecasted during policy preparation are also assessed. The Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) of grid modernization measures are also assessed as per the provisions of World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) to meet the overall requirement of sustainable development. The outcomes of this study will surely help policy makers and researchers to visualize the impacts of policy measures regarding AT&C loss reduction in a better way compared to typical simulation test results.}

abstract = {This paper reports on major outcomes of the ERA-PLANET (The European network for observing our changing planet) project, which was funded under Horizon 2020 ERA-net co-funding scheme. ERA-PLANET strengthened the European Research Area in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) in coherence with the European participation to Group on Earth Observation and the Copernicus European Union’s Earth Observation programme. ERA-PLANET was implemented through four projects focused on smart cities and resilient societies (SMURBS), resource efficiency and environmental management (GEOEssential), global changes and environmental treaties (iGOSP) and polar areas and natural resources (iCUPE). These projects developed specific science-policy workflows and interfaces to address selected environmental policy issues and design cost-effective strategies aiming to achieve targeted objectives. Key Enabling Technologies were implemented to enhancing ‘data to knowledge’ transition for supporting environmental policy making. Data cube technologies, the Virtual Earth Laboratory, Earth Observation ontologies and Knowledge Platforms were developed and used for such applications. SMURBS brought a substantial contribution to resilient cities and human settlements topics that were adopted by GEO as its 4th engagement priority, bringing the urban resilience topic in the GEO agenda on par with climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction linked to environmental policies. GEOEssential is contributing to the development of Essential Variables (EVs) concept, which is encouraging and should allow the EO community to complete the description of the Earth System with EVs in a close future. This will clearly improve our capacity to address intertwined environmental and development policies as a Nexus. iGOSP supports the implementation of the GEO Flagship on Mercury (GOS4M) and the GEO Initiative on POPs (GOS4POPs) by developing a new integrated approach for global real-time monitoring of environmental quality with respect to air, water and human matrices contamination by toxic substances, like mercury and persistent organic pollutants. iGOSP developed end-user-oriented Knowledge Hubs that provide data repository systems integrated with data management consoles and knowledge information systems. The main outcomes from iCUPE are the novel and comprehensive data sets and a modelling activity that contributed to delivering science-based insights for the Arctic region. Applications enable defining and monitoring of Arctic Essential Variables and sets up processes towards UN2030 SDGs that include health (SDG 3), clean water resources and sanitation (SDGs 6 and 14).}

abstract = {Human capital development, attractions of sustainable living standards and renewed concerns for the planet have redirected city planners to a new frontier: the creation of sustainable cities. This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2% of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities’ planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution.}

Segmentation and volume regeneration of the thyroid is particularly important for identifying thyroid-related diseases since the majority of these problems result in a change in the thyroid’s shape and scale over time. There is an urgent need for research on the disease’s origins and spread. The Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence all provide real-time processing for a variety of applications in the healthcare sector. In healthcare and biomedicine applications, machine learning algorithms are increasingly being utilized to make critical choices. Thyroid patients urgently need a robust and latency-sensitive Quality of Service framework. This paper aims to integrate fog computing and artificial intelligence with smart health to provide a dependable platform for thyroid infection early detection. To identify thyroid patients, a novel ensemble-based classifier is proposed. The thyroid dataset is obtained from the UCI library and the simulation is carried out utilizing Python programming. To increase the framework’s security, encryption and decryption methods are suggested. The suggested framework’s performance is assessed in terms of latency, network use, RAM utilization, and energy consumption. On the other side, the suggested classifier’s accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and F1 score are all assessed. The result demonstrates that the suggested framework and classifier perform consistently better than conventional frameworks and classifiers.}

The aim of this paper is to explore Generation Z consumers' current perceptions, expectations and recommendations in terms of their future interactions in smart retailing contexts. To do so, we used a qualitative approach by conducting a series of semi-structured in depth interviews with 38 university students-consumers in the UK market. The findings showed that smart technologies have a significant influence on generation Z consumers' experiences. Moreover, this particular group of consumers expects various new devices and electronic processes to be widely available, thus offering consumers more autonomy and faster transactions. In addition, they expect the technology to enable them to make more informed shopping decisions. Interviewees also stressed the importance of training consumers how to use new smart retailing applications. In addition, some of the participants were sceptical about the effects of further advancing smart retailing on part of the job market. Relevant theoretical and practical implications are also provided.}

It also looks into whether the presence of these two groups of workers has greater benefits for larger cities than smaller locations, thus justifying policies to attract these workers in order to make German cities ‘smarter’. The empirical analysis is based on a probit estimation, covering 115,000 firm-level observations between 1998 and 2015. The results highlight that firms that employ creative and STEM workers are more innovative than those that do not. However, the positive connection of creative workers to innovation is limited to the boundaries of the firm, whereas that of STEM workers is as associated to the generation of considerable innovation spillovers. Hence, attracting STEM workers is more likely to end up making German cities smarter than focusing exclusively on creative workers.}

In this context, the growth of vehicles inside the university's campus is rapidly outpacing the available parking spots for students and staff as well. This issue can be mitigated by the introduction of parking management for the smart campus which targets to assist individually match drivers to vacant parking slots, saving time, enhance parking space utilization, decrease management costs, and alleviate traffic congestion. This paper develops an IoT Raspberry Pi-based parking management system (IoT-PiPMS) to help staff/students to easily find available parking spots with real-time vision and GPS coordinates, all by means of a smartphone application. Our system composes of Raspberry Pi 4 B+ (RPi) embedded computer, Pi camera module, GPS sensor, and ultrasonic sensors. In the IoT-PiPMS, RPi 4 B+ is used to gather and process data input from the sensors/camera, and the data is uploaded via Wi-Fi to the Blynk IoT server. Ultrasonic sensors and LEDs are exploited to detect the occupancy of the parking spots with the support of the Pi camera to ensure data accuracy. Besides, the GPS module is installed in the system to guide drivers to locate parking areas through the Blynk App. that discovers parking spaces availability over the Internet. The system prototype is fabricated and tested practically to prove its functionality and applicability. According to the results, the IoT-PiPMS can effectively monitor the occupancy of outdoor parking spaces in the smart campus environment, and its potency in terms of updating the data to the IoT server in real-time is also validated..}

abstract = {The present paper investigates the performance of a district solar thermal smart network capable of providing the cooling, heating, and domestic hot water needs for a group of 100 villas in the desert climate of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Evacuated tube solar collectors are distributed over the villas’ roofs, while the hot water Lithium Bromide absorption chillers and hot phase change material thermal storage tanks are located in a centralized plant. Electrical heating elements embedded in the thermal storage tanks are considered as back up auxiliary sources in case of shortages. Using the “Design Builder” energy simulation program, a typical villa constructed as per the local thermal standard has been modeled to calculate the hourly thermal loads. These hourly profiles are the initial inputs for a Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) model integrated with the Generic Optimization Program (GenOpt). The interaction between these two programs is used to find the optimized sizing of the solar collectors’ area and the hot thermal storage volume which could achieve the maximum thermo-economic performance with a 100% solar fraction. The hourly transient simulations over a one-year period show that this system can achieve up to 82.67% reduction in the annual electrical consumption as well as carbon dioxide emissions if compared to conventional district thermal plants. Furthermore, the smart network benefits have been revealed from three different aspects: generation source, transmission loop network, and end-user consumer. The feasibility analysis performed shows that adopting the smart network can enhance the profitability of the project by 34.89% if compared to central solar plants. Also, it gives the end-user the opportunity to participate in energy production through buying the solar collectors installed on their roofs, and thus further enhancing the reduction in their annual thermal bills from 23.13% to 82.88% in a payback period of 4 years and 11 months.}
