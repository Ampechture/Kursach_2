abstract = {A higher degree of automation for autonomous systems with fault prediction on mobile machines creates the need for digitization in machine control. We do not need to control a mobile machine, but we need create complex systems with sensors, machine vision, along with positioning systems and cloud for remote management. All of these needs are available in industrial control systems, but we take into account extreme demanding on environmental conditions. This presentation introduces complex mobile control systems, designed for external conditions, connected with the IoT world to fulfill the criteria for autonomous systems in the agro sector or cloud systems with prediction for the Smart City concept.}

abstract = {Smart cities try to use technology and data to improve the efficiency of city services, to address societal challenges and to improve collaboration between citizens and government. Driving such social change requires a deep socio-ecological transition with both organisations and individual's lifestyles needing to change. This has led to an increasing recognition of the need for education to empower people to play a more active role within smart city initiatives. This paper examines our use of a MOOC as a tool to facilitate attitudinal learning around the topic of smart cities and to explore whether the learners engage in local smart city activities. A mixed methods research design was employed, collecting data via an online survey that was completed by 202 learners and through in-depth interviews with 8 of those learners. The results show that learners' perceived high levels of attitudinal learning on the topic of smart cities across four categories of learning outcomes (general, cognitive, affective and behavioural). Our findings also contribute to an understanding of the types of post-course activities learners participate in and their experiences of trying to apply what they learnt if they participated in local smart city activities. We conclude by providing new insights into how to design for learning to support social change in the context of a MOOC.}

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets out under its 11th goal—Building Sustainable Cities and Communities—the worldwide relevant target reference used to understand better the needs of a smart city. The definition of the stakeholder community’s vision about the future shape of the city and the systems making it a smart city is one of the key stages in smart city development. City foresight is viewed as the science of thinking about the future of cities. Many urban communities’ resort to foresight exercises as they help highlight and aggregate the needs of multiple stakeholders, suggest innovative solutions, and define a time horizon needed for developing realistic initiatives for city transformation. City foresight enables the exploration of alternative development paths, and therefore provides practical tools for policy-makers to enhance their decision-making capabilities by using different scenario design exercises and exploratory hypotheses. The objective of this chapter is to shed light on the salience of foresight exercises in the transformation of cities into smart cities. For this purpose, we have systematized the foresight exercises and have made theoretical clarifications and classifications of forecast data, activities, and techniques used in city foresight, underlining the importance of foresight exercises for smart cities and their benefits. This systematization is useful for understanding the multiple alternatives, from which one can choose in order to define a foresight exercise, prior to putting forward practical initiatives transforming the city systems and public governance policies for a smart city.}

It then applies this framework to several divergent cases from the mobile services sector in which city governments are involved as part of their efforts in becoming “smarter cities”. By weighing the indicators for each case study, we can create a grid that allows for their direct comparison and gives an indication of diverging strategies. The newly introduced structured framework and its qualitative indicators are the main contribution of this work and can be used to set out or evaluate smart city strategies on a meso-level, as part of a broader policy exercise within cities.}

In developing the first idea, we study past and on-going initiatives in the field of sustainable cities and livable cities and their respective monitoring indicators to demonstrate that not only is a set of indicators needed for efficient monitoring, but also a final synthetic or aggregative index to visualize the initiative's achievements. Specifically, we propose the construction of synthetic indices using principal component analysis (PCA). The second idea attempts to anticipate the changes needed, especially with regard to data collection, to be introduced in current monitoring practices to assess a city's “smartness” accurately. We propose the use of real-time data instead of historical statistics as the basic information with which to construct a set of indicators to explain the initiative. A final index summarizing Smart Cities' real-time set of indicators is suggested in the conclusion.}

This work aims at supporting coordinated emergency management in smart cities based on the localization of first responders during crisis events. We present a hybrid cloud architecture for managing computing and storage resources needed by command & control activities in emergency scenarios, complemented by a first responder localization service relying on a novel positioning approach which combines the strength of signals received from landmarks placed by first responders on the crisis site with information obtained from motion sensors.}

Due to context idiosyncrasies, the models available to measure ongoing sustainable efforts in affluent cities are not suitable for cities in Latin America. Issues related to the lack of infrastructure, the absence of primary and sustainable services, and the problems derived from economic, social, and political environment constraints, which are remarkable in some Latin American cities, have been mostly overcome in the western global north cities. A mere reproduction of successful technological solutions adopted by some cities of the Global North does not mean that the results achieved there will be equally obtained in Latin America. Latin American cities are unevenly developed and in need of different and customized solutions. In the absence of a conceptual and widely accepted methodology to evaluate the smartness of a city considering the Latin America context and in accordance to the literature, this research proposes an innovative model and indicators, levelling up the importance of dimensions less remarkable in previous models. Latin American cities must use their own model to measure their ongoing sustainable efforts that consider the idiosyncrasies of the region while not being tempted to use models from affluent regions, avoiding the risk of reiterating a top-bottom approach and thus using an inappropriate tool.}

Therefore, the crowd monitoring, prevention of stampedes and crowd-related emergencies in the smart cities are major challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent decision computing based paradigm for crowd monitoring in the smart city. In the intelligent computing based framework, the optimization algorithm is applied to compute the feature of crowd motion and measure the correlation between agents based motion model and the crowd data using extended Kalman filtering approach and KL-divergence technique. The proposed framework measures the correlation measure based on extracted novel distinctive feature, and holistic feature of crowd data represent and to classify the crowd motion of individual. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields 96.20% average precision in classifying real-world highly dense crowd scenes.}

While traditional contact tracing approaches are gradually being replaced by peer-to-peer smartphone-based systems, the new applications tend to ignore the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem that is steadily growing in smart city environments. This work presents a contact tracing framework that logs smart space users’ co-existence using IoT devices as reference anchors. The design is non-intrusive as it relies on passive wireless interactions between each user’s carried equipment (e.g., smartphone, wearable, proximity card) with an IoT device by utilizing received signal strength indicators (RSSI). The proposed framework can log the identities for the interacting pair, their estimated distance, and the overlapping time duration. Also, we propose a machine learning-based infection risk classification method to characterize each interaction that relies on RSSI-based attributes and contact details. Finally, the proposed contact tracing framework’s performance is evaluated through a real-world case study of actual wireless interactions between users and IoT devices through Bluetooth Low Energy advertising. The results demonstrate the system’s capability to accurately capture contact between mobile users and assess their infection risk provided adequate model training over time.}

In effect, decision makers varying from government administrations to private sector have log started using information technology asa mean of to evolve cities, and maintain a consistent correlation between the population culture and the environment they live in, moreover, the solutions they came up with where specific to many problems but unique to each one, as efficient as it may seem to be. Moreover, the technology sector was long ago mature enough to turn inanimate objects into smart objects that interact with each other, and send data. As a result, these solutions make it possible to extract a great amount of data, which is used to turn future predictions more accurate. Nevertheless, the technical solutions are not designed to cover data from multiple sectors, and if so, they lack the possibility to be extended with new sector layers without going through a whole development processes that can turn the old system obsolete. Therefore, as a solution in this paper, to cover new aspects and facilitate addition of new layers of data types, we brought out an abstract layer to cover not only natural events (temperature, humidity, water level, noise) that occurs in the urban field of a city, but also, urban events for example: train arrivals, accidents (traffic, security infringements), population concentration variation, etc, we called it complex events.Furthermore, we also present the architecture of a system that is scalable and supports the variety of complex events, how it collects and broadcast it to external actors.}

The 21st planning cities processes tend to consider an inclusive approach, where citizen participation takes a special interest; therefore, it contributes with the purpose to obtain receptive cities which are focused on the citizen. About mobility, the conventional planning mobility approach has been changing toward sustainable smart mobility to guarantee the participation of all social groups and reduce the effects associated with transport such as energy consumption, CO2 release, air quality, wasted space in the streets or impact on public health. Due to the current conditions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, mobility meaning has been changed from transport modes, their needs, accessibility, and affordability that constitutes a forced and disruptive adaptation process of existing models to plan, manage and implement sustainable mobility systems. Under this consideration, the mobility evaluation in the current context is based on the pillars of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental issues; furthermore, in the receptive cities’ scenario, it is necessary to articulate an additional component: planning and governance, where the technology integration, knowledge and people participation will make it possible to achieve the goals of sustainable and smart mobility. To achieve a participatory evaluation proposal for sustainable and smart mobility, it is relevant to bear in mind the fundamental principles of citizen participation and determine the desired level of participation, that in receptive cities the greatest citizen commitment is expected, so, they can contribute with their knowledge and life experiences to achieve more effective, efficient, relevant, and sustainable results over time. Finally, some of the aspects registered in this proposal for the urban mobility evaluation are related to the invert mobility priorities, the global context and environmental quality, the built environment, connectivity, urban design, and transport-oriented sustainable communities, financial management, the use of technology in the city, among others, to contribute to the proposed objective.}

India has decided to leapfrog in this area and started to implement 100 smart cities in Phase-I where the work on building these cities has already began. The framework for these smart cities is divided into two major parts. The first part has some basic requirements that all smart cities need to fulfill, and the second is specific to needs, location, or the history of issues to be solved in that city. In addition, based on the geographical location of the city, the smart-city proposals additionally include the areas that specifically work on the business, social, and economic requirements of that city. In case of any previous history of natural calamity in city, the proposals furthermore work on plans to reduce the impact of disasters in cities. This chapter attempts to first bring in need for standardization by collating some of the basic requirements of smart cities, keeping data security guidelines in mind, and comes with a usable list of applications, which can benefit from open architecture and infrastructure standardization. When used at national level, this open architecture and standardization can provide aggregated information at the national level. Additionally, reusability of applications and processes across various smart cities makes the extension of similar applications to other smart cities faster and at lower costs. Standardization together with open smart-city architecture also brings out the need and delivery of “community-led innovation” environment. However the work requires data managers who work with the head of city or the mayor and with the central agencies at the central level and can help in creating these innovations on the data. These community-led innovations on the data can be effectively used and also monetized.}

Nevertheless, this system needs people who watch the camera images, watch the recording after something occurred, or watch when the camera notifies them of any movement. These are the disadvantages. Furthermore, there are many Smart Cities and Smart Homes around the world. This is why we thought of using the idea of the Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IP cameras. In our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through Computer Vision to detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we are able to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as if they were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer Vision is a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could we work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy to automate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of these hypotheses required a testing over our Computer Vision module to check the possibilities that we have to use this module in a possible real environment with a good accuracy. Our proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis of entire sequence instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors in the Internet of Things.}

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.}

abstract = {With the exponential rise in networked infrastructure and advancement of the IoT, the smart city has become an emerging paradigm. The main attributes of a smart city are to monitor the physical world in real time, provide smart services to inhabitants in terms of healthcare, environment, entertainment, transportation, and energy. However, as smart city applications collect wide range of privacy-sensitive information, various issues pertaining to security of data in such systems need to be addressed. On such applications that demands high degree of privacy in an IoT based healthcare setup is security of Electronic Health Records (EHR). Further, as smart city based applications have to react to real time situations, there is a growing demand for more and more computationally efficient algorithms for such applications. In this paper a high capacity, secure and computationally efficient Electronic Health Record (EHR) hiding technique in medical images in an Internet of Things (IoT) driven healthcare system is proposed. The scheme is based on Pixel Repetition Method (PRM) and modular arithmetic. Pixel Repetition Method has been used to scale up the input medical image for cover image generation and modular arithmetic has been used to embed the secret EHR into the scaled-up images. The proposed scheme has been extensively tested for various commonly used medical/test images, and a group of randomly chosen images from UCID repository. Experimental investigations reveal that the proposed system besides being reversible is capable of providing secure and high embedding capacity while maintaining fair imperceptibility. Further the usage of PRM for cover image generation has been found to be highly efficient from computational point of view compared to state-of- art in the area and hence is best suited for the exchange of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in an IoT based healthcare system for smart city applications.}

However, in addition to traditional threats, the IoD may suffer from new threats and requires customized methods to combat the security weaknesses. Very recently, Wazid et al. proposed a security solution for securing IoD application scenario and claimed its security. However, in this paper we show that their scheme cannot resist stolen verifier and traceability attacks. Moreover, an attacker with access to the verifier, can impersonate any user, drone or server of the system. An enhanced scheme is then proposed to cope with these weaknesses. The security claims of proposed scheme are endorsed by formal and informal security analysis. Moreover, the performance and security comparisons show that proposed scheme completes a cycle of authentication with a slight increase in computation time, but it offers all the required security features as compared with the scheme of Wazid et al.}

There are two objectives of the article: 1) determination of which CRIsPI features would motivate young citizens to higher participation, and 2) comparative analysis of six prioritization methods to select the most appropriate method for engagement of this group of citizens. In total, 155 respondents (students) participated in the study. Results revealed that respondents require easy-to-use tools and positive feedback from the local government. Moreover, they prefer mobile solutions. The most suitable prioritization method, according to five given criteria, is adjusted cumulative voting ($100).}

Many promising initiatives have emerged over the years. Despite these initiatives, there is still a lack of understanding about an appropriate definition of smart transport system. As such, it is challenging to identify the appropriate indicators of ‘smartness’. This paper proposes a comprehensive and practical framework to benchmark cities according to the smartness in their transportation systems. The proposed methodology was illustrated using a set of data collected from 26 cities across the world through web search and contacting relevant transport authorities and agencies. Results showed that London, Seattle and Sydney were among the world’s top smart transport cities. In particular, Seattle and Paris ranked high in smart private transport services while London and Singapore scored high on public transport services. London also appeared to be the smartest in terms of emergency transport services. The key value of the proposed innovative framework lies in a comparative analysis among cities, facilitating city-to-city learning.}

In the work, based on the collected historical data of Xixian City, Henan Province, China, using the Internet of Things system (IoT) in 2011-2018, a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) multi-step flood prediction model with attention mechanism is proposed. In our model, the attention mechanism is used to automatically adjust the matching degree between the input features and output. Besides, we use a bidirectional GRU model, which can process the input sequence from two directions of time series (chronologically and antichronologically), then merge their representations together. Compared with the prediction model using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), our method can generate better prediction result, as can be seen from the arrival time error and peak error of floods during multi-step predictions.}

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is more likely to be the target of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to the risk of a single point of failure. To better defend against DDoS attacks, we focus on tracing the source and propose a statistics-based traceback scheme using the advantages of the SDN architecture. We analyze the changes of flow through the Base Station (BS) nodes to calculate the eigenvalue and establish the anomaly tree. Then prune it with DDoS detection algorithm to get the attack path. Through the experiments, we obtain the optimal parameters to make the proposed scheme more flexible and effective. It shows that the scheme consumes fewer network resources and saves time than traditional ones while keeping the DDoS defense accuracy at a high level.}

Modern urban agglomerations tend to turn nowadays into advanced information hubs supporting a smart management of dynamic urban systems. The currently popular notion of ‘smart cities’ aims to provide a new perspective for sustainable and high-performance strategies of city stakeholders in our ‘urban century’. In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza’ strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of ‘big digital data’ management in urban systems.}

Our view of a typical smart city consists of four key components, namely, Smart Grids, Building Automation Systems (BAS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Vehicles; with enabling Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and the Cloud platform. The adversarial threats and criminal misuses in a smart city are increasingly heterogenous and significant, with provisioning of resilient and end-to-end security being a daunting task. When a cyber incident involving critical components of the smart city infrastructure occurs, appropriate measures can be taken to identify and enumerate concrete evidence to facilitate the forensic investigation process. Forensic preparedness and lessons learned from past forensic analysis can help protect the smart city against future incidents. This paper presents a holistic view of the security landscape of a smart city, identifying security threats and providing deep insight into digital investigation in the context of the smart city.}

In order to address this issue, the paper brings together knowledge-based development concept with smart and sustainable cities. Knowledge-based development is a vision of development that considers knowledge as the central structuring element of a development strategy. Similarly, its more territory focused version, knowledge-based urban development is an integrated approach for the transition of cities and regions into sustainable, liveable and prosperous localities. The methodological approach of the paper includes the review of the literature on existing approaches on smart and sustainable cities assessment, describing their main aspects, strengths and limitations, and discuss the potential contribution of a knowledge-based urban development strategy for the successful promotion of smart and sustainable cities, presented in a proposed conceptual framework.}

This data is heterogeneous in nature which varies with respect to time and exhibits the properties of all essential V’s for big data. Therefore, to handle such an enormous amount of data, various big data processing techniques are required. To cope up with these issues, this paper presents a tensor-based big data management technique to reduce the dimensionality of data gathered from the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) environment in a smart city. The core data is extracted out of the gathered data by using tensor operations such as-matricization, vectorization and tensorization with the help of higher-order singular value decomposition. This core data is then stored on the cloud in the reduced form. After reducing the dimensionality of data, it is used for providing many services in smart cities; and its application to provide demand response (DR) services has been discussed in this paper. For this purpose, support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is used to classify the end-users (residential and commercial) into normal, overloaded and underloaded categories from the core data. Once such users are identified to take part in DR mechanism, utilities then generate commands to handle their DR in order to alter load requirements so that the overall load is optimized. Results obtained on Open Energy Information and PJM dataset clearly indicate the supremacy of the proposed tensor-based scheme over the traditional scheme for DR management.}

The utilization of the Internet-of-Things and Edge-of-Things technologies presents a significant foundation for the development of smart cities where intelligent transportation system is one of the most important applications. Due to the obvious advantages of reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, electric vehicles are playing an increasingly important role in the intelligent transportation system. However, there is no shared framework for the interaction between electric vehicles and intelligent transportation system in smart cities. To handle this issue, this work proposes a practical framework to collect trajectory data of electric vehicles via edge devices and use a novel modified dynamic time warping method to analyze drivers’ preference. The analysis based on real data shows that a certain percentage of electric vehicle drivers have driving preference. That is, they tend to go through specific routes or locations during commuting. Furthermore, a few simulation experiments are conducted to compare the system performance between the time-of-use and load-of-use pricing strategies of the charging stations. The results demonstrate that the load-of-use pricing strategy can effectively divert the traffic flow and balance the load differences between different charging stations.}

This paper ranks 28 European capital cities based on how smart and sustainable they are. Using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), we synthesized 32 indicators into 4 components and computed rank scores. The ranking of European capital cities was based on this rank score. Our results show that Berlin and other Nordic capital cities lead the ranking, while Sofia and Bucharest obtained the lowest rank scores, and are thus not yet on the path of being smart and sustainable. While our city rank scores show little correlation with city size and city population, there is a significant positive correlation with the cities’ GDP per inhabitant, which is an indicator for wealth. Lastly, we detect a geographical divide: 12 of the top 14 cities are Western European; 11 of the bottom 14 cities are Eastern European. These results will help cities understand where they stand vis-à-vis other cities, giving policy makers an opportunity to identify areas for improvement while leveraging areas of strength.}

However, increasingly the same technologies are susceptible to cybersecurity threats. This chapter’s objective is to examine the connection between cybersecurity and the sustainability and resilience capabilities of smart cities. To this end, this chapter maps the most common types of cybersecurity threats and their impact on smart city domains such as transportation, health, home, and others. These are examined and assessed by considering each layer of the smart city architecture proposed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The discussion is embedded in the broader framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG11), in which the notion of city’s resilience and sustainability is stressed.}

abstract = {We present a framework to support creative design of emergency management scenarios. By creative design of scenarios we mean the process of imagining situations and describing them through models and stories. The framework supports the tasks of gathering and organizing knowledge about emergency management situations by automatically generating conceptual models, related to fragments of emergency scenarios. It leverages semantics-based techniques to enable a computational creativity approach. A software application was defined to support the activities of modeling scenarios by permitting to generate, organize, and query sets of these conceptual models, which we name mini-stories, and that can be adopted to inspire the activity of creative design. Selected mini-stories are blueprints for more detailed user scenario descriptions and models that can be used, for instance, for analysis or simulation. As a case study, we consider emergency management in smart cities. This is a challenging domain because smart cities are characterized by interconnected physical and virtual services forming complex ecosystems, which provide sophisticated services to the population and to institutions, manage public resources in a optimal way, and involve citizens in decisional processes. As a consequence, smart city ecosystems can be threatened by several hazards spanning from natural disasters, as tsunami and earthquakes, to anthropic events, as terrorist attacks. Ability of service providers and institutional operators to face and manage emergency situations is therefore a relevant issue. Simulation and analysis of both crisis events and executions of management plans are a promising approach to deal with these articulated problems. However, manual definition of models to base the analysis is a demanding activity due to the huge number of different situations to consider. It requires knowledge related to the crisis and emergency domains, to the context (e.g., a specific city and its current regulations) and ability in modeling tasks. All these aspects demand for tools to support modeling activities, and our proposal aims at fulfilling this need. In particular, the discussed framework uses in a integrated way three types of knowledge: structural knowledge, to support the construction of models based on design patterns; domain knowledge, here related to smart cities and emergency management and represented by means of ontologies; and contextual knowledge, related to specific aspects (e.g., localization) of the considered scenario and represented as rules. We validated the presented approach by means of experiments performed by real city planners.}

The models used in professional literature usually provide accurate forecasts, but in case of congestion, forecasts can be highly inaccurate. At the heart of these situations are complex processes taking place on the road network of the city, which the prediction models are rarely prepared for. The congestion phenomena propagating on the road network of large cities have a major impact on the development of traffic patterns. In this article, we present a new traffic prediction model, the Congestion-based Traffic Prediction Model (CTPM), which refines previous forecasts based on congestion propagation patterns. Our aim is to show that using congestion data can greatly improve our forecasts. The developed model can be used in conjunction with any previous model, so there is no need to replace well-functioning methods. To the best of our knowledge, no method has yet been developed that takes traffic information into account for forecasting in such a way. Our performance studies have shown that by using CTPM we were able to refine traffic forecasts by an average of 9.76%.}

We aim to develop a systematic classification and analysis of the barriers hindering successful implementation of smart energy city projects. Through an empirical approach, we investigated 43 communities implementing smart and sustainable energy city projects under the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes of the European Union. Validated through literature review, we identified 35 barriers categorized in policy, administrative, legal, financial, market, environmental, technical, social, and information-and-awareness dimensions. We prioritized these barriers, using a novel multi-dimensional methodology that simultaneously analyses barriers based on frequency, level of impact, causal relationship among barriers, origin, and scale. The results indicate that the key barriers are lacking or fragmented political support on the long term at the policy level, and lack of good cooperation and acceptance among project partners, insufficient external financial support, lack of skilled and trained personnel, and fragmented ownership at the project level. The outcome of the research should aid policy-makers to better understand and prioritize implementation barriers to develop effective action and policy interventions towards more successful implementation of smart energy city projects.}

Knowledge graphs help to provide semantic and interconnectivity capabilities to the intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for detecting outliers in the trajectory. Normal and outlier graphs are constructed using directed weighted graphs. Then, comparison with source and target graphs leading to vectors is performed. The similarity measure is used, which measures common nodes and edges. The features are then used by the machine learning based algorithm to classify the trajectory. Instead of a manually tuned parameter, the tree-based pipeline optimization method selects the best classifier and its hyperparameter. Then, the tuned model is compared with the traditional algorithms, i.e., random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. To evaluate the system under real conditions, an experiment is performed on a real dataset of trajectories. The results show that the graph-based method performs well and achieves an F-value of 0.81, while the optimization model achieves an F-value of 0.87. The graph-based model matched with the learning method helps to detect outliers and deviation points of the trajectory with high precision.}

Moreover, with the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across the world, healthcare waste has become even more infectious like never before and showing its potential for claiming lives if not disposed properly. Additionally, the COVID-19 has put up another challenge in terms of exponentially increasing demand for personal protective equipments for healthcare workers such as doctors, nurses, ward boys, and sanitation workers. In this paper, seven criteria related to smart healthcare waste disposal system infused by circular economy aspects to recover value from disposables are identified and analysed using a decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The criteria have been prioritized by its importance and net cause and effect relationship through a causal diagram. Two criteria, (i) digitally connected healthcare centres, waste disposal firms and pollution control board, and (ii) providing a pollution control board’s feedback app to public and other stakeholders, feature as strong reasons for a smart healthcare waste disposal system. Conclusively, this study provides a causal relationship model among the intertwined drivers of industry 4.0 and circular economy for developing a smart healthcare waste disposal system enriched with the benefits of circular economy.}

In smart cities adding to general computing comes with processing delays in addition to transmission delay. So smart cities process added to cloud/edge computing, which provides a promising way of enabling applications by offering computation and storage resources with low latency. Edge computing reduces the network bandwidth usage by alleviating the transmission of data from end-users to the remote cloud. The edge computing paradigm is characterized primarily by its geodistributed, low latency. In addition to the edge, fog node covers a wide range of devices such as routers, wireless access points, and data centers. In smart cities that infrastructure provides novel security risks and challenges due to centralized cloud. To enable security must protect all devices from attacks by implementing diverse security mechanisms. Security in edge computing is mainly based on the denial of services and privacy leakage. To avoid attacks, we are providing smart contracts through the reduction of need in trusted intermediates, fraud losses as well as reduction of malicious intentions. It must be devised for edge computing enabled in smart cities to ensure user privacy. In smart cities, decision making is based on data combined with analytics to improve decision making. Enabling the resource-intensive and latency-sensitive smart city applications provides a solution for reliable performance of increasing end-users. The surveillance camera in small cities continuously takes images of the cities and requires further processing of these images to determine the wrong activities in smart cities. Edge computing to enable on-demand telecommunication and computing infrastructure helps to assist rescue activities. The major issue of smart cities includes latency, security, and decision making. The requirements of the latency and security in smart cities can be satisfied by edge computing and fog computing. This technique is used to decrease latency and increase security in the smart cities project.}

The cloud provides an efficient and cost-effective platform on which they can manage, store and process data, as well as build applications performing complex computations and analyses. The quickly changing requirements in a Smart City require flexible software architectures that let these applications scale in a distributed environment such as the cloud. Smart Cities have to deal with huge amounts of data including sensitive information about infrastructure and citizens. In order to leverage the benefits of the cloud, in particular in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness, this data should be stored in a public cloud. However, in such an environment, sensitive data needs to be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. In this paper, we present a software architecture design that can be used as a template for the implementation of Smart City applications. The design is based on the microservice architectural style, which provides properties that help make Smart City applications scalable and flexible. In addition, we present a hybrid approach to securing sensitive data in the cloud. Our architecture design combines a public cloud with a trusted private environment. To store data in a cost-effective manner in the public cloud, we encrypt metadata items with CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption) and actual Smart City data with symmetric encryption. This approach allows data to be shared across multiple administrations and makes efficient use of cloud resources. We show the applicability of our design by implementing a web-based application for urban risk management. We evaluate our architecture based on qualitative criteria, benchmark the performance of our security approach, and discuss it regarding honest-but-curious cloud providers as well as attackers trying to access user data through eavesdropping. Our findings indicate that the microservice architectural style fits the requirements of scalable Smart City applications while the proposed security approach helps prevent unauthorized access.}

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.}

abstract = {In contrast to the ongoing worldwide uncontrolled expansion of urban development resulting in sprawled cities, compact cities have been argued by planners and researchers to be the more sustainable urban form. However, in compact cities, it has been shown that a low proportion of green spaces jeopardizes the sufficient supply of urban ecosystem services. This suggests that there remains a deficiency in clear visions for operationalizing compact and green cities. To remediate this, this paper introduces a systemic conceptual framework for compact and green cities by combining the concepts of smart growth and green infrastructure. The indicator-based, smart-compact-green city framework includes two aspects: 1) smart compact cities (considering the need to limit urban sprawl through smart growth) and 2) smart green cities (reflecting the preservation and (re-)development of urban green infrastructure). The paper suggests that there is the need to balance these two aspects to develop a systemic approach towards smart-compact-green cities. A hierarchical target system grounded on four characters for smart compact and smart green cities is developed. Smart-compact-green cities can be characterized through a 1) smart environment of compact and green cities, 2) smart multifunctionality of compact and green cities (economic, social, environmental), 3) smart government for compact and green cities and 4) smart governance for compact and green cities. The characters comprise twelve factors defined by 39 indicators for smart compact cities and 44 indicators for smart green cities, respectively. The systemic framework can support researchers and practitioners to develop visions of how existing or future cities can approach smart-compact-green cities in mainstreaming the ecology of and for cities by better understanding the complexity of urban systems and providing a basis for a systematic spatial monitoring.}

Therefore, healthcare systems utilize the convergence power and traffic analysis of sensors that cannot be satisfactorily handled by the IoT. In this article, a novel mutation operator is devised and incorporated with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Two tests have been conducted in the validation process. Firstly, the newly dual adaption-based operators incorporated with the differential evolution algorithm are being proposed. The proposed approach provides sufficient diversity and enhances the search speed of nature’s local and global search environments in the problem. The proposed method incorporates the application of IoT-based smart healthcare. Second, an application-based test has been conducted, in which the proposed approach is applied to the application in the smart healthcare system. Therefore, IoT sensor deployment is an optimization problem to minimize service time, delay, and energy loss by considering the communication constraint between sensors(objects). The proposed algorithm is applied in this article to solve this optimization problem. Further, in the experimentation and comparative study, the proposed method is superior to the standard evolutionary algorithms in IoT applications concerning the minimum number of function evaluations and minimization of traffic services. The proposed approach also achieves efficiency in the minimum loss of energy in each service and reduces load and delay.}

abstract = {Transforming infrastructures, buildings and services with the sensed data from the Internet of Things (IoT) technique has drawn wide attention. Enormous video data from city surveillance cameras poses huge challenges of transmission, storage and analysis, which necessitates new video compression technologies. The fusion of video data generated from smart city could be used to support city management and urban policy. Based on the specific characteristics of surveillance video, which are successive pictures have very strong correlations and each picture can be divided into background and foreground, this work proposes a block-level background modeling (BBM) algorithm to support long-term reference structure for efficient surveillance video coding. A rate–distortion optimization for surveillance source (SRDO) algorithm is also developed to improve the coding performance. Experimental results show that the proposed BBM and SRDO can significantly improve the compression performance, which can effectively support diverse video applications in smart city.}

abstract = {Within the growing literature on smart cities, much research has focused on issues related to the formation stage of these initiatives. After initial subsidies expire, however, a number of smart city initiatives face problems with respect to value creation and value capture. To analyse these processes, the paper links value creation (i.e. activities focusing on innovation challenges) to value capture (i.e. activities referring to actual individual firm-level profit generation) in smart city initiatives. Based on an in-depth survey of the literature, the purpose of the paper is to better understand how processes of internal alignment foster value creation and value capture during the growth of smart city initiatives. By focusing on the determinants of internal alignment facilitating value creation and value capture, the paper examines these determinants in the context of four smart city initiatives in the Netherlands in 2016. The paper shows that internal alignment of actors aimed at integrating joint and business objectives is critical for the growth of smart city initiatives. From the theoretical view point, the paper points at challenges concerning internal alignment of different actors in the smart city initiative after the formation stage. From the managerial point of view, it becomes increasingly important to manage expectations of different partners and their learning efforts to account for internal alignment during the growth of the smart city initiative.}

We select and test a project developed in Nice (France) where 5.000+ sensors are deployed on parking slots to improve the urban transport. The benefits of the IT project are determined comparing data extracting from Nice and compared with two other similar cities (Marseille and Toulon) which play the role of control group. The analysis of the value creation and value capture suggest a governance model for a private and public collaboration.

Although oil and gas resources lead the way of fuel production due to their low cost, alternative sources such as wind and solar renewable energy and nuclear energy have also gained popularity forcing the technological development of fuel production technologies. Hydrogen is a source for the production of energy by using any energy resource. In this chapter, we investigate the latest fuel production technologies providing energy outputs from renewable energy resources for their usage in smart cities. We study the role of renewable resources under the current dynamics of the global energy market situation as well as the effects of fuel production technologies to increase the efficiency and sustainability for the future of smart cities. This review includes a broad spectrum that spans from the technical energy resources literature with very comprehensive research by using SCOPUS database to nontechnical but renowned resources including journals and other publications including raw data as well as forecasts and opinions that respected experts have performed. Specifically, solar and wind production technologies, as well as future forecasts compared with the conventional fuel resources, are reviewed comprehensively. By that, we aim to shed a light on the current status of fuel production technologies in renewable energy resources and their usage in smart cities.}

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed.}

Processing is embedded in high performance SoCs (System-on-Chip) achieving real-time performance (≈ 100 fps - frames per second) which enables efficiently managing video streams of more cameras source at lower frame rate. Cloud server gathers results from nodes to carry out biometric facial identification, tracking, and perimeter monitoring. A Quality and Resource Management module monitors data bandwidth and triggers reconfiguration adapting the transmitted video resolution. This also enables a flexible use of the network by multiple cameras while maintaining the accuracy of biometric identification. A real-world example shows a reduction of ≈ 75% bandwidth use with respect to the no-reconfiguration scenario.}

In this context, real-time data streams are continuously produced and analysed by efficient and effective algorithms, which are able to handle complexities related to big data, in order to enable the core functions of Decision Support Systems in the smart city. These algorithms should receive input data coming from different city domains (or pillars) and process, aggregate and reason over them in a way that it is possible to find hidden correlations among different and heterogeneous elements (e.g., traffic, weather, cultural events) along space and time dimensions. This paper proposes the online implementation and deployment of Temporal Fuzzy Concept Analysis on a distributed real-time computation system, based on Apache Storm, to face with big data stream analysis in the smart city context. Such online distributed algorithm is able to incrementally generate the timed fuzzy lattice that organizes the knowledge on several and cross-domain aspects of the city. Temporal patterns, of how situations evolve in the city, can be elicited by both exploring the lattice and observing its growth in order to obtain actionable knowledge to support smart city decision-making processes.}

In this paper, we consider and critique the rationalities and practices of commercially-oriented hackathons. Drawing on Gabriel Tarde and recent re-engagement of his ideas, we analyse the spatiotemporal practices that modulate the passion and imitation in and around hackathons. We document how hackathon schedules and spaces are arranged in ways to extend but also exploit participants’ passions for digital innovation and entrepreneurship, act as sites of upskilling and career progression, but also reproduce neoliberal and entrepreneurial labour and urban development. We argue that hackathons interpellate by attracting participants to desire and believe in entrepreneurial life and technocratic rationality to the effect of furthering the precarity of work and life and intensifying the corporatisation of cities. As such, hackathons reinforce the neoliberal underpinnings and ethos of entrepreneurial and smart urbanism.}

In practice, however, central governments and international policymakers have been unable to provide a successful policy architecture. Yet, city-level initiatives within the Smart City framework are a promising way to tackle climate change. An example of such a Smart City framework is the London Environment Strategy (LES). In this paper, we propose a zero mean reverting model for greenhouse gas emissions to quantitatively analyze its consistency with the 2050 Zero Carbon objectives. We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport. We find that, on average, only transport improves the historical greenhouse gas emissions trend, and most of this reduction comes from Smart Mobility and/or Smart Regulation programs focusing on the environment.}

This involves a combination of smart infrastructure, innovative technologies and the use of ‘soft assets’ to create more effective integration of the changes within each urban community. This paper outlines and analyses a framework to measure soft assets in SC implementation to assist policy discussions in urban development. The different approaches to identifying and measuring intangible or soft assets by leading researchers, practitioners, and public organizations are reviewed and evaluated. Fundamentally, intangible/soft assets are unique, and context-dependent by nature. They are powerful assets creating value and are connected to other assets to yield outcomes and impact according to alignment to SC objectives. Reviewing several approaches to measurement clearly indicates that the way intangible/soft assets are addressed differ according to different frameworks used, including the accounting framework, strength of management control, and using the assets as an integral part of knowledge management. These tools make it possible to identify, measure and understand the roles of soft assets and explain how they are intricately linked at multi-dimensional and multi-tier levels of urban development. Effective use of soft assets greatly strengthens the ability of a city administration or Local Government Unit (LGU) to provide innovative solutions and create value if the assets are optimized and aligned with the SC development goals. The value creation framework is also changed and adapted accordingly. Thus understanding SC effectiveness is increased by properly defining and providing an evaluation framework for soft assets which in turn assists policy makers and LGU administration make SCs more sustainable.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.}

Through observation, we found that existing solutions apply one common privacy-preserving rule for all devices while they address the heterogeneity issue separately that lead to unappealing performance. In this paper, we propose a framework for addressing the heterogeneity issue and privacy-preserving of IoT devices at the network edge using a novel proposed ontology data model. Besides, it leverages the proposed ontology to obtain a privacy-preserving method by frequently changing the privacy-preserving behaviors of IoT devices. Through simulation, we show that our solution overhead is less than 9 percent in the worst situation so that it is affordable to most IoT devices in one of its applications that is smart city.}

In this chapter, it has been assumed that the implementation of smart city governance is possible thanks to the adoption of appropriate development policies (to increase public participation, improve access to information-communication technologies and the open data policy), which are conducive to the development of platforms intended for stimulating bottom-up participatory. Attention is paid mainly to platforms that serve the phenomena called coproduction (including geoparticipation, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, hackathons, Living Labs, gamification) and cocreation of value (e.g., urban hacktivism and BarCamps).}

However, huge amount of information is the main characteristic of multi-camera system, and we have truly been in big data era for image/video processing. In the development of modern smart city, how to make accurate image retrieval in multi-camera system should be considered seriously. In previous researches, many approaches have been put forward. To the best of our knowledge, there is few research focusing on the method based on distributed fault-tolerant processing (DFP) method. The introduction of DFP will greatly improve the processing rate based on cloud computing, so it will be beneficial to the improvement of this issue. In this paper, we propose a distributed image-retrieval method designed for cloud-computing based multi-camera system in smart city. Through the combination of the cloud storage technology, data encryption and data retrieval technology, we achieve efficient integration and management of multi-camera resources. In this way, the cloud computing network data will be released more quickly, which can provide convenient storage service for users. What is more, experimental results show the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed method, compared with previous processing methods.}

These emerge from innovations in information technology that, while they create new economic and social opportunities, pose challenges to our security and expectations of privacy. Humans are already interconnected via smart phones and gadgets. Smart energy meters, security devices and smart appliances are being used in many cities. Homes, cars, public venues and other social systems are now on their path to the full connectivity known as the “Internet of Things.” Standards are evolving for all of these potentially connected systems. They will lead to unprecedented improvements in the quality of life. To benefit from them, city infrastructures and services are changing with new interconnected systems for monitoring, control and automation. Intelligent transportation, public and private, will access a web of interconnected data from GPS location to weather and traffic updates. Integrated systems will aid public safety, emergency responders and in disaster recovery. We examine two important and entangled challenges: security and privacy. Security includes illegal access to information and attacks causing physical disruptions in service availability. As digital citizens are more and more instrumented with data available about their location and activities, privacy seems to disappear. Privacy protecting systems that gather data and trigger emergency response when needed are technological challenges that go hand-in-hand with the continuous security challenges. Their implementation is essential for a Smart City in which we would wish to live. We also present a model representing the interactions between person, servers and things. Those are the major element in the Smart City and their interactions are what we need to protect.}

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve’ urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.}

Smart City ontology is not yet standardized, and a lot of research work is needed to identify models that can easily support the data reconciliation, the management of the complexity, to allow the data reasoning. In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a big data volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to a smart-city ontology, called KM4City (Knowledge Model for City), and stored into an RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries to provide new services to the users via specific applications of public administration and enterprises. The paper presents the process adopted to produce the ontology and the big data architecture for the knowledge base feeding on the basis of open and private data, and the mechanisms adopted for the data verification, reconciliation and validation. Some examples about the possible usage of the coherent big data knowledge base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-store and related services.

Offering a critical synthesis of the material, it advances a Triple Helix inspired account of smart cities as future internet-based developments. In particular, as future internet-based developments covering the digital infrastructures, data management systems, renewable energies and cloud computing of a regional innovation in the Internet of Things (IoT). More specifically, as a regional innovation in the IoT that covers the morphology of urban extensions, infill and mass retrofits, which smart cities call for the development of. Focusing on the metrics of mass retrofit proposals, the paper also serves to demonstrate how the urban morphology of such regional innovations matter in the sense they tell us that being aware of the considerable energy savings and CO2 reductions, which IoTs offer cities to be smart, is not enough. Not enough, because without knowing whether the costs and benefits under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts are shared equally, it is impossible to say if the 65% energy saving and 78% reduction in CO2, attributed to the data collection, information processing and smart (micro) grids of mass retrofits is socially just. The paper suggests that in order to verify this, it is necessary for smart cities to first baseline the social-demographic structure of retrofit proposals. Then draw upon the environmental profile this evaluation generates to assess whether the regional innovation creates the wealth needed to under-grid the sustainability of city-districts. Under-grid the sustainability of city-districts as the energy efficient-low carbon zones of an inclusive growth strategy seen to be socially just. Seen to be socially just, because the costs and benefits underlying the 1.5 ha ecological footprint that surfaces from this regional innovation are equally appropriated as the proceeds of a wealth creation, which contributes to the resilience of city-districts as energy efficient-low carbon zones. As energy efficient-low carbon zones, whose inclusive growth strategy also emerges as a post-carbon economy claiming to be climate neutral.}

In these applications, various devices can be identified using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, which can be used for transferring the collected data to other local or remote objects at various geographical locations. However, for automatic reading of data accumulated in an RFID-tag embedded in an object/device, authentication is required at various stages for the aforementioned applications. In RFID-based systems for smart applications, an RFID-tag may be operated from several meters distance and it does not require to be put within direct line-of-sight of the reader like a barcode system. Therefore, the traditional barcode system will be replaced by the RFID authentication system in near future since in the later, technology reading of a large amount of data within short span is possible. However, in existing RFID-based authentication systems, an adversary may access the RFID-tag information, which can compromise the privacy and it may also create forgery problems. In addition, RFID-based authentication is suffering from heavy computation burden since an RFID-tag has very limited computation capability. To address these issues, lots of anonymous RFID-based authentication schemes have been designed using lightweight cryptographic tools, e.g., the hash function and symmetric key encryption. However, all these schemes failed to achieve known security and functionality requirements. Motivated by the above-mentioned issues, in this paper, we have put forwarded an RFID-based authentication architecture for distributed IoT (Internet of Things) applications suitable for the future smart city environments. Subsequently, we have put forwarded a lightweight RFID-based authentication scheme to provide reasonable execution time compared to existing schemes. Our scheme provides forward secrecy, anonymity and untraceability of RFID-tag, and secure localization. In summary, the proposed scheme can be used in wide range of applications in smart city environments.}

Energy storage systems play a very important role in smart grids. The characteristics of smart cities enhance the use of high power density storage systems, such as SMES systems. Because of this, we studied the possibility of adapting these systems in this kind of electrical topology by simulating the effects of an energy storage system with high power density (as SMES). An electrical and control adaptation circuit for storing energy was designed. The circuit consisted of three blocks. The first one was a passive filter LCL. The second was a converter system that allows rectifying of the signal when the system runs in charge mode but acts as an inverter when it changes to discharge mode. Finally, there is a chopper that allows the current levels to be modified. Throughout simulations, we have seen the possibility of controlling the energy supply so as the storage. This permits to adapt to different contingencies which may induce the wiring of the charge in the net, as well as different types of charges. Despite the technical contribution of this kind of systems in the Spanish electrical network, there are big obstacles that would prevent its inclusion in the network, such as the high cost of manufacturing and maintenance compared with other cheaper systems such as superconductors or the low energy density, which limits their use.}

This work presents a real case project in which an infrastructure was needed for gathering information from drivers in a big city, analyzing that information and sending real-time recommendations to improve driving efficiency and safety on roads. The challenge was to support the real-time recommendation service in a city with thousands of simultaneous drivers at the lowest possible cost. In addition, in order to estimate the ability of an infrastructure to handle load, a simulator that emulates the data produced by a given amount of simultaneous drivers was also developed. Experiments with the simulator show how recent stream processing platforms like Apache Kafka could replace custom-made streaming servers in a smart city to achieve a higher scalability and faster responses, together with cost reduction.}

This Chapter offers an overall analysis of all participating cities in the Smarter Cities Challenge based on their democracy scores—obtained from the Democracy Index 2018. This is followed by summary accounts of a few case study cities involved with the Challenge to provide tangible narrations of the role that different levels of democratic governance (e.g., full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes) have played in smart city development. The overall goal is to identify whether or how much democracy matters in the ways in which cities around the world adopt smart solutions.}

In this paper, we present a mobile edge-based collaborative solution against identity theft over social platforms by taking advantage of the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks in the 5G Era. The collaborative framework delegates detection of a potential identity theft to other smart users who are the connections of the potential victim over a social platform. The collaborating smart users are not involved in semantic analysis but are assigned a subset of the contextual features of the smart user under review. We present thorough performance evaluation by using real social platform data in simulations. The numerical results show that collaboration among smart users can reveal anomalous behavior on the social accounts of other participants with a success ratio at the order of >90%. Furthermore, we show that false positive (FP) decisions can be mitigated while false negatives, which are less severe than FPs, can be reduced down to the order of ≤3%.}

abstract = {In the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has affected the approach of organizations to innovation and how they create and capture value in everyday business activities. This is compounded in the so-called Smart Cities, where the objective of the IoT is to exploit information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support added-value services for citizens, giving companies more opportunities to innovate through the use of the latest technologies. In this context, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are building alliances, starting several projects with public and private city stakeholders aimed at exploring new technologies for cities but also at exploiting new IoT-based devices and services in order to profit from them. This implies that companies need to manage and integrate different types of knowledge to efficiently and effectively support the simultaneous pressure of exploration and exploitation, at a project portfolio level. Using structural equations modeling with data collected from 43 IoT smart city project alliances in Italy, this paper tests and finds evidence that MNEs need to develop knowledge management (KM) capabilities combined with ICT capabilities if they want to obtain greater ambidexterity performance at the project portfolio level. More specifically, we highlight that KM capabilities enhance alliance ambidexterity indirectly through firms' ICT capabilities, suggesting that MNE managers should design KM tools and develop new ICT skills. Implications for academics, managers and future lines of research are proposed.}

The main focus is to find the means of providing information as early as possible to receiver which is prerequisite in smart cities. In this paper, routing is based on the shortest path which is selected using TOPSIS optimization and achieves balance between performance and energy consumption with regard to four criteria’s: 1) Least distance of selected nodes from the base station, 2) Residual Energy, 3) minimum Euclidean distance between mth selected node and 4) next optimum nth node in the transmission range and number of neighboring nodes. Finally, Simulations are conducted in MATLAB in order to demonstrate how the proposed method would work to locate the best node in each cycle and confirm its effectiveness.}

In this paper I quantify this process. Using data from about 6,1 million patents and 60 million academic publications I examine the complexity of technologies and knowledge developed in major Chinese cities and compare these to those produced in other global cities. The results show that (1) knowledge and technologies produced in Chinese cities has increasingly taken a greater share of total output of global cities; (2) the quality of this output has increased over time; (3) Chinese cities improve the quality of their knowledge output before increasing the quality of technology; and (4) only Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen compete with other global cities in terms of the quality of output, suggesting emerging regional inequality within China linked to knowledge and technology production. Not only is the size of the Chinese economy increasing, so is the quantity and quality of its knowledge and technology output.}

To obtain information on the geospatial information availability in Indonesian cities, a survey has been carried out nationally from April – July 2015, as part of a research on spatial data infrastructure. 90 cities/districts participated in the survey. The findings show that majority of the cities/districts have limited availability of large scale topographic maps and land parcel maps.

The proposed system considers the use of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as storage units. The problem involves distinct types of vehicles and a community, composed of small houses, residential areas and different Renewable Energy Resources. In order to highlight possibilities for power dispatching, the optimization of three distinct goals is considered in the analysis: mini/microgrid total costs; usage of vehicles batteries; and maximum grid peak load. Sets of non-dominated solutions are obtained using a mathematical programming based heuristic (Matheuristic). By analyzing cases of study composed with up to 70 vehicles, we emphasize that PEVs and UAVs can effectively contribute for renewable energy integration into mini/microgrid systems. Smart cities policy makers and citizens are suggested to consider the proposed tool for supporting decision making for cities under development, guiding their choices for future investments on renewable energy resources.}

This data is then complemented by qualitative expert interviews with actors in the field, such as cities, interest groups and developers. In the context of the current debate surrounding what constitutes a Smart City and the importance of smartphones and mobile in this area, we perform a reality check, using Brussels as a case. We find that the laggard position Brussels is currently in could be an opportunity to leapfrog in the field of mobile services, but that a focused vision and clear mobile strategy, while thinking of the city as a local innovation platform built on open data, is quintessential to achieving this.}

The user has nothing to do but normally approach a controlled entry: authentication is automatically triggered by ambient elements (beacons). This transparent protocol entails user awareness of the authentication since the user has to install a suitable app, therefore it does not cause any covert privacy violation. In addition, it allows avoiding any explicit, possibly cumbersome authentication procedure. Last but not least, the use of a sensor directly embedded in everyday users’ equipment supports an efficient approach without the need for further hardware.}

In this study, the importance of value recovery from trash bins is highlighted. A stochastic optimization model based on chance-constrained programming is developed to optimize the planning of waste collection operations. The objective of the proposed optimization model is to minimize the total transportation cost while maximizing the recovery of value still embedded in waste bins. The value of collected waste is modeled as an uncertain parameter to reflect the uncertain value that can be recovered from each trash bin due to the uncertain condition and quality of waste. The application of the proposed model is shown by using a numerical example. The study opens new venues for incorporating the value recovery aspect into waste collection planning and development of new data acquisition technologies that enable municipalities to monitor the mix of recyclables embedded in individual trash bins.}

The development of infrastructure, vehicle technology and global business opportunities are giving rise to carbon footprints. The production of energy based vehicles is the key for all the nations to reduce the carbon emissions to a great extent and preserve the green environment. The research in the area of energy conservation is promoted world-wide by switching from patrol/diesel based engines to electric vehicles. The consistent efforts are made by many researchers and industries to save energy by consuming minimal electricity to drive the vehicle. There is also a need to create awareness among the users of electric vehicles that their effort to use electric vehicles may help the mother earth from the further deterioration and in reduction of air pollution. Without creating awareness among the users, the initiative of green planet cannot be completed successfully. In order to prove the hypothesis of the research study, the data is collected through a survey which is based on the questionnaire on energy vehicle consumers. This research study analyzes the potential users of energy based vehicles and their expectations from the energy based vehicles. The feature dimensions of the data source are finalized and the size range of the value is determined. Then the feature transformations is devised such as feature reduction and feature merger to make changes in the feature dimension of the original data source to facilitate the solution of the problem statement. Then the statistical analysis is performed with the aid of detection of outliers and missing values, interpretation of data, correlation between the variables and analysis of data. This model can be adopted by the manufacturers of electric vehicles to create awareness in the users about the benefits of using electric vehicles such as reduction in carbon emissions, improvement in air quality index (AQI), saving of natural resources and protection of green environment.}
