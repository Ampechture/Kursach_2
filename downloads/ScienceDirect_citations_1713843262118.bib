abstract = {The modern port structure is configured as territorial system of productive aggregation (hub) of a complex nature, strongly linked to the productive fabric of a larger territory and in close relationship with the context in which the port is physically located. In the development of processes of innovation and improvement of the sustainability of the activities connected to the port, a strong connection is necessary between all the local stakeholders who, each for the functions of their own competence, can activate improvement processes with common objectives. This paper describes a framework for the activation and coordination of a Locally Integrated Partnership (LIP) towards the development of a multi-term Smart Port Management Strategy (SPMS) to support innovation processes in the sustainable and safe management of the port. The methodology was applied to the case study of the port of Ravenna (Italy) where the state-owned areas managed by Port Authority (public authority managing the port area) are limited to 50 mt-width harbour quay, while the remaining areas are owned by private companies. The result was the development and the implementation of the roadmap for the development of the SPMS of Ravenna Port with a multi-stakeholder participatory approach. This process favoured the activation of many public funds to modernize port infrastructure, as well as private investments for the development and dissemination of innovations and for the sustainable use of port area. This has shown how the development and coordination of a local LIP makes it possible to make synergies between stakeholders more effective in accessing financing funds and sharing development strategies aimed at innovation and sustainability. The framework developed and tested to the case study demonstrated the benefits of a participatory and inclusive process in decision-making processes, with a benefit for all the key aspects of sustainability. This process can be used, following step-by-step, as a guideline for other port areas.}

abstract = {The increase in the number of vehicles on roads has compounded the difficulty in parking them when people go out for movies, shopping, theatre, etc. Thus, this paper proposes smart parking system. The reservation of the parking slots can be made using this proposed smart parking system. Unlike the methods proposed in the existing research, the system proposed in this paper divides the parking area into 3 parts. One for conventional parking, one for vehicles with reservation and the other for the vehicles with and without reservation. Learning automata is used in the proposed system to determine the percentage of the parking area for conventional parking. In general, the proportionate of the slots for reserved parking, conventional parking and common slots need to be assumed. Learning Automata helps in determining this proportionate optimally. The AES-256 encryption algorithm is used to provide security for the details provided by the user during reservation process. Goodput value is maintained for each vehicle which increases or decreases the chances of getting a reservation. The time limit for the reservation of the parking slot is also maintained after which the reservation gets cancelled automatically. Markov Model is used to represent the system. The performance of the proposed algorithm, Learning Automata and Reservation based Secure Smart Parking System (LA-RSSPS) is simulated and evaluated in terms of average waiting time, search time, the probability with which the vehicles do not get parking slot when they do not have reservation and the probability with which the vehicles do not get reservation and is compared with ProNet and iERS. Results have shown that our scheme preforms better than the ProNet and iERS competing schemes. The comparison of analytical and simulations results are also presented.}

These systems are modelled and dynamically simulated in Transient Systems Simulation Program (TRNSYS) 18. A case study is discussed, where the proposed systems exhibit promising results in terms of primary energy saving: for example, the renewable energy matches almost 74–77% of the district primary energy demand for the analyzed smart energy districts.

Combined multi-weight decision algorithm with the greedy perimeter stateless routing protocol, designed and evaluated standardized function for link stability. Linear additive weighting is used to optimize link stability and distance to improve the packet delivery rate of the IoV.

Objective is to assess economic, operation, flexibility, and reliability goals of the distribution system operator. Objective function minimizes costs of operation, reliability, energy losses, and network flexibility. Scheme is constrained by AC optimal power flow equations, network reliability limitation, and integrated system model. Scheme utilizes scenario-based stochastic optimization to model of uncertainties, such as load, parameters of renewable resources, energy prices, and the availability of network equipment. Novelty is modeling and performance evaluation of the proposed integrated system as a type of flexibility resource in the operation of distribution systems proportional to the economic, operation, flexibility, and reliability objectives of the network operator. Numerical results demonstrate energy management capabilities of the discussed integrated energy system, which contribute to enhancing economic and technical conditions of distribution network. The inclusion of hydrogen storage in the renewable integrated energy system has been found to enhance the economic viability, operational efficiency, and reliability of the distribution network by around 46.8%, 41%–53%, and 95%, respectively, when compared to network power flow.

Bike-sharing, as an emission-free travel mode, aligns with the principle of green and environmental protection and serves mainly for short-distance trips in urban areas. Shared bikes pose significant issues to operators due to supply–demand imbalances across different time and space. This study proposes a Smart Predict-then-Optimize method for dynamic green bike relocation in the free-floating system, which aims to minimize the cost of fuel and carbon emissions from repositioning vehicles and the total unmet demand during the operating period. A multi-task deep neural network model is designed to predict regional inflow and outflow demand, where targeted modules are embedded to extract the spatio-temporal characteristics. Potential unusable shared bikes are discovered from the users’ travel behavior and the usage characteristics of shared bikes. Then, we build a data-driven optimization model for bike-sharing relocation and design an iterative decomposition algorithm that incorporates an adaptive large neighborhood search for relocation routes and vehicle speed optimization. The proposed method is tested on real-world bike-sharing trips in Shenzhen, China, and results show that the relocation distance and carbon emission cost can be reduced by 11.69% and 14.09% by relocating operational bikes and unusable bikes simultaneously. Additionally, route decision-making with speed optimization can decrease the total fuel and emission, where considering the collection of unusable bikes help improve the service level of the system.}

It has played a significant part in connecting all smart devices over the internet, allowing them to share services and resources globally. However, as devices become more connected, they become more exposed to various forms of malicious activities. The DDoS and DoS attacks are the major one that can disrupt the regular operation of network and expose the malicious information. So detecting and preventing the attacks in the WoT is a significant research area.

abstract = {The traditional power network has now evolved into the smart grid, where cyber technology enables automated control, greater efficiency, and improved stability. However, this integration of information technology exposes critical infrastructure to potential cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the interdependent nature of the grid’s composite information and operational technology networks means that vulnerability extends across interconnected devices and systems. Therefore, a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, which is relatively easy to deploy but potentially highly disruptive, can be used strategically against the smart grid with particularly egregious results. In this paper, we take inspiration from epidemiological modelling to propose a compromise propagation model, alongside a behavioural DDoS model, to explore how dependencies between the grid’s networks might influence the scale and impact of DDoS attacks. We found that the internal connectedness of a network amplifies the received impact of failures in an external network on which it is dependent. Furthermore, testing showed that alongside attack force, attack duration influences recovery times, due to both the quantity of resources consumed and the time needed to accumulate recoveries. The models were validated against simulations conducted with cyber-security providers L7 Defense, showing our approach to be a viable companion or alternative to traditional graph-based dependency models.}

Therefore, maintaining and enhancing the functionality of sewer projects at an affordable cost are major challenges for decision-makers. However, the embracement of the Value Engineering (VE) concept to assess new sewer designs has not yet been fully embraced especially in developing countries. Thus, this study introduces a systematic VE approach for major sewer projects. A computer model based on six phases of VE methodology was developed, and named “Value Engineering Model” (VEM). To show its efficacy, it was applied to a real-life case study, leading to the following major contributions to the body of relevant knowledge: (1) unraveling the logical relations between the project functions, (2) a detailed life cycle cost analysis (LCCA), (3) a weighted evaluation matrix towards facilitating the decision-making procedure and (4) achieving an approximate 36% reduction in the sewer's project cost as compared to the common VE analysis technique. The developed model serves as a guide for design engineers and decision-makers in sewer projects. It will enable achieving the embracement of smart and sustainable drainage systems within cities at a greater pace. The results of this study will be a guide for decision-makers to reduce costs and improve sustainability by introducing VEs in the Egyptian sewer industry.}

Specifically, this research focuses on multimodal integration models for PTS that consider the existing infrastructure system and the socioeconomic issues typical of an island environment. This topic has received inadequate consideration in the scientific literature on islands. To achieve these aims, an analytical-numerical approach is adopted. Starting from initial origin-destination matrices (O/D) surveyed by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), a methodology was implemented to compute the geographical distribution of trips, and thereafter, the values distributed over the whole region were interpolated by Surfer software with the Kriging method. This methodology was applied to the Sardinia case study particularly emblematic because it has seen a tremendous transition over the previous decades, resulting in a massive socio-economic gap between inland and coastal areas, that led to an increase in private vehicles for transportation purposes, primarily for business and pleasure. The application, replicable in other islands that have highlighted the same socio-economic problems linked to poor mobility planning, shows an accessible spatial planning approach, combining PTS and rental for driver services, by considering the principles and issues of island contexts. This research gives an important scientific contribution by emphasising the quality of transport infrastructures, place-based organisation, population distribution, and physical configuration of the Insular Region, as well as by considering the most pressing issues of island contexts. Findings could help island governments in revising their policy and practice of transport, accordingly.}

The input parameters used to construct the model are latitude of the station (deg), ambient temperature (°C), inside airflow (m3/min) and time (h). These input parameters are employed to predict heat flow (W) and maximum plate temperature (°C) inside the utility box. The results show that the ANFIS-PSO model provides an accurate prediction of R-value >0.95 for the test data, which is close to the maximum theoretically value of 1. The results showed that for the small amount of latitude, the maximum heat flow and temperature of the inside air is not detected at noon and the radiation heat flow to the vertical cylinder is maximized between sunrise and noon as well as between noon and sunset. The model also demonstrated that for the northern conditions, the temperature levels of heat generated over 30 °C are limited.}

Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the enabling technologies for a smart grid network. As the IoT connected devices continue to grow at a rapid pace, one of the major challenges is security since the devices are online hence making the smart grid vulnerable to significant attacks. Since an IoT based smart grid would consist of potentially millions of nodes, it has the largest attack surface for an IoT focused cyber-attack. A cyber-attack on a smart grid would have devastating effects on reliability of widespread infrastructure given the potential cascade effects of shutting down the electricity grid since most of the devices in our homes, offices, hospitals and trains require electricity to run. Once a single device is compromised, then the whole grid becomes vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks on electricity supply can grind entire cities to a halt thereby causing huge financial and economic losses. This makes security a critical factor to consider before large scale deployment of IoT based smart grid networks. In this paper we review and explore the major challenges and security issues stunting the growth of IoT-based smart grid networks.}

abstract = {High traffic flow in a confined tunnel makes fire safety a critical issue. This paper proposed a digital twin framework for tunnel fire safety management in real-time, driven by dynamic sensor data and AIoT technologies. A deep learning model trained by the Transformer network and simulation dataset is used to predict real-time fire location and size. Then, the AI model is integrated into a 3D digital twin platform developed by the game engine Unity 3D. The performance of the proposed digital twin framework is demonstrated using numerical experiments and large-scale tunnel fire tests. Results show that the established AI model achieved promising accuracy in predicting fire location and power for both numerical and experimental data. The digital twin platform can also visualize the 3D fire scene that supports evacuation, firefighting, and emergency rescue. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a 3D environment and digital twin in real-time fire safety management.}

abstract = {Fuel Hydrogen cells become nowadays a major candidate to replace the diesel in powering the traction locomotives since they offer low emission of pollutant gases, high efficiency, and flexible modular structure without the need for installation of electrification infrastructure for railway networks. However, they cannot respond appropriately to the fast load transients due to their slow internal electrochemical and thermodynamic responses. Therefore, they shall be integrated with fast dynamics Li-ion battery cells to form a hybrid power source for traction systems. Accordingly, this paper presents a development of a new smart integrated power source of fuel hydrogen and Li-ion battery cells to supply dual three-phase machines for driving the trains in railway networks. The developed control management system is regulating the two power sources according to the train operational modes as well as the battery state of charge. In addition to that, dual three-phase machines offer several superiorities over the conventional three-phase machines such as lower harmonic distortion and power losses along with higher power density and fault tolerance. A designated railway line is nominated through selection criteria in this paper for the implementation of the new smart drive traction system in HIL platform using Typhoon HIL real time simulator. Moreover, an optimization analysis has been carried out to reduce the overall hydrogen consumption with the same journey time spent for a designated railway line using particle swarm optimization approach. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate a proof of concept for designing the hydrogen refueling station for such railways which are supplied by the new integrated power source of fuel hydrogen and Li-ion battery cells. The case study investigates the site selection, operational assessment, and equipment requirements.}

The integration of IoT technology in the Smart Grids is a critical way to accelerate the digitization of the power grid and is useful for the efficient performance of the energy grid infrastructure. For efficient real-time data analysis and decision-making, the Internet of Things will incorporate various communication systems seamlessly. To achieve efficient communication between all Internet of Things, devices are expected to use multiple means, including smart sensors, cable and wireless communication. Improved Internet of Things sensor technologies and connectivity could theoretically prevent or minimize the potential to natural disaster transmission lines, improve transmission power capacity and reduce economic losses. A smart grid is a variety of sensors, devices, and data sets that continuously capture high-resolution data equal to individual IoT conditions. A vast amount of data is one of the biggest challenges on the Internet of Things. Edge Computing is trying to process data close to linked sensors to address this problem, where the data is gathered and processed. This paper aims to investigate the edge computing solutions for the smart grid. A comprehensive review of both emerging issues and edge computing in the Smart Grid environment is discussed and explained. There are two primary components to the energy sharing process among Prosumers: information/digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence Scheduling Techniques. Each of them is mentioned in detail to discuss the Prosumer smart Grid. Furthermore, Edge Computing and classifications (cloudlet, Fog computing and Multi-Access) are among the suitable network methods mentioned in this paper. Some techniques and methodologies have been extensively covered to improve reader awareness of the Prosumer smart grid system.}

This data represents how public transport users from a whole city or country travel during consecutive days or weeks. This work presents a method to identify temporal weekly patterns of primary activities performed by public transport users in Singapore. As continuous travel data from the same user during a week can be extracted, work-leisure cycles can be recognized. Using revealed trips from a 1% sample household travel survey, activities reached and left by public transport were extracted and used to develop two discrete choice models: one for workers and one for students. According to the start time and duration of an activity, these models estimate the likelihood of such activity to be HOME, WORK/STUDY or OTHER type. Then, consistent activities were extracted from public transport smart card transactions recorded during one week. Using the discrete choice models, these extracted activities were classified by type. For each user, a 14-dimension vector summarizes his/her primary activity pattern. Each vector is composed by start time and duration of his/her work or study activities during continuous 7days. To recognize the most common primary activity patterns of the city, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm was applied to these vectors. As the input data of this method is commonly available, the method can be applied to many cities in the world.}

Purposefully, new technologies and solutions have emerged such as renewable-energy systems, electric vehicles, and micro-grids. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) technologies, Smart Grid (SG) concept is becoming more attractive, whereby it refers to upgrading conventional power-grid infrastructure in order to offer automated control over the resources and emerging technologies in smart and sustainable cities. The implementation of this automated control requires robust and secure bidirectional communication systems. However, legacy-networking paradigms failed to address flexibility in their design to meet SG-networking requirements. Alternatively, Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm provides two powerful networking solutions namely, decoupling control from the data layer and network programmability, which can enhance the robustness of communication networks in modern societies. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to present an overview of integrating Software-Defined WSN (SDWSN) concept in SGs in order to solve the aforementioned challenges and improve network robustness. We categorize literature attempts, describe enabling devices and communication technologies, and we suggest open research issues and opportunities associated with integrating SDWSN paradigm into SGs.}

The paper studies the spatiotemporal differentiation and influencing factors of China's shrinking cities by constructing a decision model of the shrinking city. The results show that although growth is still the main theme of city development in China. Shrinkage or potential shrinkage has gradually also emerged as prominent, and showing certain spatial agglomeration distribution characteristics. Socioeconomic development, urban environment, urban space scale and population development were also found jointly to affect city shrinkage. These research conclusions provide a reference point for the government and planners to formulate evidence based urban development policies and guide shrinking cities down the path of smart shrinkage.}

The overall concept for achieving such communities is first described, and then the current research is presented – focusing on the electricity generation and storage within the community. Three key degrees of freedom are exploited: buildings with very low and coordinated energy demand; strong residents participation; a large share of local energy generation with its storage in the houses. The starting point is to maximise the energy efficiency of individual buildings. As the buildings in the analysed community were built according to the obtained optimisation results and are inhabited by users, the authors assessed the actual energy consumption in relation to the design value in Design Builder software. The detected discrepancy was only 3.8%. That modelling accuracy allows further steps to achieve a fully energy-self-sufficient community. This is illustrated using a real example of a 40-building nZEB community in Poland, independent of the energy supply from the grid. The presented approach demonstrates a Smart City solution for a community of single-family houses with confirmed very low final energy demand and potential Greenhouse Gas reduction of up to 96%.}

In 2013 the Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management initiated a policy programme that aimed to develop a transition towards smart mobility. A Roadmap was developed to support the policy innovation programme because previous initiatives have failed due to the lack of a strategic document. The Roadmap’s first transition pathway (policy goal) called for a development of a user-centric smart mobility. We analysed how this policy goal has been enacted. We conducted 32 semi-structured interviews with relevant smart mobility practitioners, which we have analysed through our theoretical framework consisting of three boundary concepts: boundary work, boundary objects and boundary organisations. Additionally, we have drawn from the literature on user-involvement. The boundary concepts have led us to identifying two main challenges that led to an unsuccessful realisation of the policy goal. One, the responsibilities for involving users have been transferred to numerous actors, who renegotiated the goals assigned to them by the Ministry, resorting to their old techno-centric innovating ways. The dominance of the techno-centric perspective acted as a barrier and inhibited a successful implementation of a more user-centric approach. Two, a key criterion for successful realisation of the pathway – namely, the support of an organisation specifically held accountable for realising the pathway – was absent. In our conclusion we provide recommendations for a more successful user-inclusion, as well as reflections on the state of the smart mobility policy in The Netherlands.}

Thus, police operations should be planned and designed taking into account the interests of three main groups of directly affected stakeholders (i.e., general population, minorities, and police agents) to pursue fairness. Most models presented so far in the literature failed at this, optimizing cost efficiency or operational effectiveness instead while disregarding other social goals. In this paper, a Smart Policing model that produces operational patrolling districts and includes territorial, racial, and workload fairness criteria is proposed. The patrolling configurations are designed according to the territorial distribution of crime risk and population subgroups, while equalizing the total risk exposure across the districts, according to the preferences of a decision-maker. The model is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer program. Computational experiments on randomly generated data are used to empirically draw insights into the relationship between the fairness criteria considered. Finally, the model is tested and validated on a real-world dataset about the Central District of Madrid (Spain). Experiments show that the model identifies solutions that dominate the current patrolling configuration used.}

Amongst these novel technologies, Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as a pivotal avenue for harnessing mechanical energy with remarkable energy conversion efficiency, compact device dimensions, robust longevity, and intrinsic compatibility with wearables and implantables. Such attributes render them highly promising for integration into micro-nano-systems.

Methodology of study is planned on three core factors i.e. literature review, a data of building defects, and application development process. An inclusive database of low rise building defects (secondary data) was acquired from from earlier research of first author. The acquired secondary data from Chohan, A.H (2007) has surfaced the various types of building defects and their implications in low rise RCC construction/buildings. Data was validated through participation at site and 10 major segments of building defects were identified. Through review of literature research validity was established, application development process was accomplished and various IoT models and similar application were identified. In application development process, study has set the hierarchy of building defects, construed app. development process in domain of building surveying, validate the data, and developed a conceptual plan of smart survey. In addition, defined the development process of mobile application. In section 3, this research has explained the development of mobile application through three major steps i.e. classifying data, setting defects hierarchy and application development. Study has succeeded to surface a prototype framework of smart “Smart Condition Survey” (SCS) which can be practically used for development of real-time mobile application.}

abstract = {Hydraulic modeling of a foul sewer system (FSS) enables a better understanding of the behavior of the system and its effective management. However, there is generally a lack of sufficient field measurement data for FSS model development due to the low number of in-situ sensors for data collection. To this end, this study proposes a new method to develop FSS models based on geotagged information and water consumption data from smart water meters that are readily available. Within the proposed method, each sewer manhole is firstly associated with a particular population whose size is estimated from geotagged data. Subsequently, a two-stage optimization framework is developed to identify daily time-series inflows for each manhole based on physical connections between manholes and population as well as sewer sensor observations. Finally, a new uncertainty analysis method is developed by mapping the probability distributions of water consumption captured by smart meters to the stochastic variations of wastewater discharges. Two real-world FSSs are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the traditional FSS model development approach in accurately simulating the values and uncertainty ranges of FSS hydraulic variables (manhole water depths and sewer flows). The proposed method is promising due to the easy availability of geotagged information as well as water consumption data from smart water meters in near future.}

In this contribution, an IoT-enabled smart energy meter based on LoRaWAN technology (SEM-LoRaWAN) is developed to measure the energy consumption for a photovoltaic (PV) system and send real-time data to the utility/consumers over the Internet for billing/monitoring purposes. The proposed SEM-LoRaWAN is implemented in a PV system to monitor related parameters (i.e., voltage, current, power, energy, light intensity, temperature, and humidity) and update this information to the cloud. A LoRa shield is attached to an Arduino microcontroller with several sensors to gather the required information and send it to a LoRaWAN gateway. We also propose an algorithm to compose data from multiple sensors as payloads and upload these data using the gateway to The Things Network (TTN). The AllThingsTalkMaker IoT server is integrated into the TTN to be accessed using Web/mobile application interfaces. System-level tests are conducted using a fabricated testbed and connected to a solar panel to prove the SEM-LoRaWAN effectiveness in terms of functionality, simplicity, reliability, and cost. The connectivity between the system and users is achieved using smartphones/laptops. Results demonstrate a smooth system operation with detailed and accurate measurements of electrical usage and PV environmental conditions in real-time.}

Several studies show that improved matching between PV generation and EV load through both optimal sizing and operation of PV-EV systems can minimize these challenges. This paper presents an optimal PV-EV sizing framework for workplace solar powered charging stations considering load matching performances. The proposed optimal sizing framework in this study uses a novel score, called self-consumption-sufficiency balance (SCSB), which conveys the balance between self-consumption (SC) and self-sufficiency (SS), based on a similar principle as the F1-score in machine learning. A high SCSB score implies that the system is close to being self-sufficient without exporting or curtailing a large share of local production. The results show that the SCSB performance tends to be higher with a larger combined PV-EV size. In addition to presenting PV-EV optimal sizing at the workplace charging station, this study also assesses a potential SC and SS enhancement with optimal operation through smart charging schemes. The results show that smart charging schemes can significantly improve the load matching performances by up to 42.6 and 40.8 percentage points for SC and SS, respectively. The smart charging scheme will also shift the combined optimal PV-EV sizes. Due to its simplicity and universality, the optimal sizing based on SCSB score proposed in this study can be a benchmark for future studies on optimal sizing of PV-EV system, or distributed generation-load in general.}

The revolution of smart technologies has transformed the traditional way of last-mile delivery from logistics outlets to IoT-based parcel lockers due to the flexibility, convenience, and 24/7 accessibility. However, there are still many obstacles affecting the transformation of last-mile delivery especially in consumers perceptions towards the smart technologies. Therefore, in this study, we performed research based on the theory of service quality and customer satisfaction in the adoption of relevant technologies. This article divides the smart parcel lockers' service quality into five dimensions: service price, service reliability, convenience, fault handling capability, and service diversity. In this study, 272 valid questionnaires were collected from China to investigate consumer satisfaction with the smart parcel locker services. Statistical analysis, including the reliability and validity, was performed, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The correlation between variables and the degree of influence on customer satisfaction and regression analysis was also undertaken in this study. The results revealed that the service price does not positively affect consumer satisfaction, and the other four underlying factors have a positive effect on consumer satisfaction. This research has significant impacts by determining the parcel lockers' core factors so as to foster the further development of last-mile services in the future.}

This issue can accurately plan the smart grid in real time with minimum cost. This paper proposes a bi-level energy management model for smart grids in uncertainty and demand-side management (DSM) in the Internet of things (IoT) platform based on WSN. In the upper level, for accurate planning in real-time and relationship with energy management system, the customers are modelled in wireless sensor network platform and clustered by fuzzy C-Means algorithm. Then, the energy consumption of the network sensors in the IoT platform is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA). Moreover, the customer behavior optimization was performed utilizing the price-based demand response (PBDR) model and transferring demand load from the peak to the valley load times. The objective functions in the lower layer minimized the emission pollution, operation costs and energy not supplied (ENS) index using the multi-objective Moth–Flame optimization (MOMFO) algorithm. The Monte Carlo technique is used for modeling renewable energy sources (RES)'s uncertain output. Finally, the suggested approach is confirmed through the analysis of a case study. The proposed model's capability in planning a uniform smart grid operation is demonstrated by simulation study and comparison with multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), epsilon-constraint and benders techniques.}

However, we do not yet know how older people's perceptions of these technologies may vary, in particular how views based on experience of actual use may differ from those related to anticipated use. We also do not know how older people living independently might view technology that may be of future rather than current value to them. This paper explores older people's views of smart home monitoring technology and compares these between people with direct experience and those without. Four focus groups were conducted with six older people recruited from the community with no smart home experience and seven drawn from a large-scale Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration that is developing a sensor platform for health and lifestyle at home. For the seven participants, the sensor platform was installed and operated in their homes for eight to twelve months before the current study. The study found that participants in each group had some similar and some different understandings of smart home technologies. Among participants who had already tried the smart home monitoring technology, acceptance increased over time and with use. They expressed fewer concerns than non smart homes participants regarding privacy, trust, usability, and more concerns about utility. Non smart home participants focused on the extent to which this technology might increase household's vulnerability and they considered the technology somewhat intrusive and noticeable. It appeared that the more positive views of participants who had direct experience of smart homes related to the degree of trust between them and the researchers who installed and maintained the smart home system. Both groups of participants shared views about the technical feasibility, affordability, impact on relationships, and about the engagement and competencies of those who would view the monitoring data. They suggested that the technology would be more acceptable if it was possible to customize functionality and features. These findings have implications for development of smart home technologies so that they are appropriate and acceptable to older people who are living independently.}

abstract = {The evolution towards smart grids (SGs) is mainly characterized by the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) throughout the grid. The intermittent nature of these sources necessitated the installation of energy storage systems (ESSs) to improve the efficiency and reliability in the power system. Moreover, the ongoing high price of batteries has encouraged the installation of shared ESSs in residential communities. However, managing the shared ESS and the energy flows in the community is considered a key challenge. In order to handle this issue, we introduce a novel energy management system (EMS), namely Energy Management In residential COmmunities with shared storage based on multi-agent systems (EMICO). It finds the optimal energy trading operations between households, as well as the operations of the shared ESS that minimize the total energy losses. We first propose a new cluster-based architecture for the residential community in which we integrate Internet of Energy (IoE) devices to manage energy flows and find the shortest path to transfer energy with minimal loss from a cluster to the other. Then, we model our energy management problem as a constrained optimization problem and we use Lagrange multiplier method to solve it in a centralized way. In order to preserve households’ privacy, we propose a decentralized approach based on multi-agent systems (MASs) to solve our problem. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a set of households located in the United Kingdom. Numerical results show that EMICO outperforms a literature approach in terms of energy losses (up to 35.66% of reduction in energy losses), electricity bill (up to 21.21% cheaper), number of exchanged messages (up to 83.81% less messages exchanged), and length of required cables (up to 95.03% less cables required).}

In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation.}

Edinburgh is interesting to simulate because it is selected to be one of the top 50 congested cities despite the traditional layout of the city with a low population density. For each mode of transportation, we test five different operational policies (from the literature) for different fleet sizes. We examine the results both in terms of system expenditures and profits, as well as service quality. Additionally, we evaluate Pareto solutions that combine policies’ performance to give a trade-off between wait times and empty miles. In comparison with private cars, the Autonomous Vehicles (AV) resulted in 86% reduction in the number of cars on the road. In addition, the use of the AVs per day is at least two to seven times higher than the UK private car usage. A reduction in the number of vehicles will have a positive influence on the congestion. When compared with the public mode, AMoD vehicles require 62% less time and 60% less distance than buses for the same trips.}

This article tackles that problem by comparing two possible ways of developing a 100% renewable energy system, using Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, as a case. The first one is a traditional non-integrated renewable energy system, where each energy sector is developed independently, while the second is based on the smart energy system concept, where different sectors are linked together in order to exploit synergies and increase the efficiency of the system. Scenarios for Zagreb according to these two approaches are developed and modelled in EnergyPLAN. The results show that a smart energy system can reach up to 49% of the total electricity production from intermittent sources on a yearly basis, while a traditional non-integrated system utilizes 50% more biomass than what is assessed to be sustainable. Therefore, a smart energy system is a beneficial option for Zagreb in terms of technical feasibility, while from an economic perspective, the total costs of the two scenarios are essentially at the same level.}

The space around the Ka'aba is limited and it is usually crowded. Pilgrims arrive at unpredictable intervals to perform the Tawaf and quickly join the crowd, which increases the population. Congestion and high density are issues that arise during the Tawaf as a result of time and space constraints. Furthermore, short proximity among pilgrims owing to the crowd during prayers, Tawaf, congregation, stay in hotels, creates a perfect environment for transmission of infectious diseases. Therefore, changes in the crowd movement pattern and smart scheduling can not only reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, but safety from being stressed and injuries which is caused due to fellow pilgrims push into each other. This problem specifically affects older people and female pilgrims. This study proposes a smart queue at various entry points to reduce the waiting time in the system as a function of the number of multiple entry/exit loops, social distancing, and arrival rates of pilgrims. The study also proposes to use Internet of Things (IoT), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies to monitor the crowd at exit/entry points that will help in capacity estimation and planning. Furthermore, the study recommends redesigning the entry and exit mechanisms for smart queues to minimize congestion and alleviate the associated problems while maintaining pilgrimage rituals. We evaluated the achievements of our proposed model by simulating historical data. The simulation results indicate that the average completion time for circumambulation is significantly reduced.}

This new design for the envelope/façade of buildings comprises two major passive and energy-free technologies, a daytime radiative cooler and a thermochromic smart window. The PDMS-silica-silver daytime passive radiative cooler can provide a cooling effect to the indoor environment without energy input, meanwhile the thermochromic smart window using PNIPAm hydrogel can passively modulate the solar irradiance entering buildings through windows. Hence, the energy needed for indoor heating, cooling and lighting can be reduced significantly. To evaluate the energy-saving performance, model houses are built, one of which is assembled using the proposed building design. The orientation effect on the indoor air temperature of the model houses is investigated. Under intensive solar irradiance, a maximum reduction of 4.8 °C of the indoor air temperature is achieved in the model house constructed using the proposed building design. An energy saving of about 17% of air-conditioning systems in buildings constructed with this new design is expected during daytime operation.}

Comprehensive modeling is conducted in the TRNSYS package based on energy, exergy, and environmental viewpoints. Results demonstrate that the proposed smart system provides all the buildings’ heating, cooling, and power demands in one year. Also, the temperature and radiation illustrations show a high potential of the solar system to be used in the city of the study. The energy system exchanges power with the network and can run the auxiliary equipment’s in the CCHP system and provides all the building’s power demand. Moreover, the additional annual power of 715.32 kWh can be sold to the grid to compensate for the building’s energy costs. Also, the maximum emission and efficiency of 0.12 ton/MWh and 34% are achieved in January and July, respectively. Moreover, the cooling capacity of 4906 kWh demonstrates the enormous potential of double effect chiller in recovering the waste heat.}

In this study, we took a technological approach to these issues. User-managed access (UMA) is a well-known framework for delegating resource access rights to others on the Internet. In UMA, authorization mechanisms are designed to be centralized so that resource owners can centrally manage access rights for various resources stored in different domains. However, the lack of transparency in the authorization mechanism is a barrier to its implementation in large-scale systems such as smart cities. In this study, we developed a blockchain-based cross-domain authorization architecture that enables a resource-sharing ecosystem in which organizations that wish to utilize data can freely trade with each other. The proposed architecture solves the transparency problem that conventional authorization systems have had by designing the authorization mechanism on blockchain technology. We implemented the proposed architecture as smart contracts and evaluated its processing performance. The resultant time required for delegating access rights and accessing resources was less than 500 ​ms. Furthermore, we found that the fluctuation in the processing time overhead was small. Based on these results, we concluded that performance degradation with the proposed architecture is minor.}

abstract = {Energy consumption prediction has always remained a concern for researchers because of the rapid growth of the human population and customers joining smart grids network for smart home facilities. Recently, the spread of COVID-19 has dramatically increased energy consumption in the residential sector. Hence, it is essential to produce energy per the residential customers' requirements, improve economic efficiency, and reduce production costs. The previously published papers in the literature have considered the overall energy consumption prediction, making it difficult for production companies to produce energy per customers' future demand. Using the proposed study, production companies can accurately have energy per their customers' needs by forecasting future energy consumption demands. Scientists and researchers are trying to minimize energy consumption by applying different optimization and prediction techniques; hence this study proposed a daily, weekly, and monthly energy consumption prediction model using Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). This study relies on a TFT model for energy forecasting, which considers both primary and valuable data sources and batch training techniques. The model's performance has been related to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTM interpretable, and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) models. The model's performance has remained better than the other algorithms, with mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.09, 2.02, and 1.50. Further, the overall symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) of LSTM, LSTM interpretable, TCN, and proposed TFT remained at 29.78%, 31.10%, 36.42%, and 26.46%, respectively. The sMAPE of the TFT has proved that the model has performed better than the other deep learning models.}

Foodborne diseases are a burden in countries worldwide. Several countries have successfully implemented policies that establish innovative systems for the inspection and grading of food service establishments (FSEs), which have greatly contributed to a reduction in foodborne diseases. China's government has also responded by developing policies to protect consumers' food safety, including the routine inspection policy and the risk-based grading policy. However, implementation of both policies has been poor to date. The aim of this study was to identify regulatory challenges and design a smart supervision solution. The results of a national survey showed that the major barriers to policy implementation were a heavy individual workload, the high turnover rate of FSEs, lack of a monitoring and evaluation system, lack of social support, low development of food safety training programs in FSEs, and a lack of financing. A smart supervision solution to these challenges was designed based on mobile Internet and two-dimensional (2D) barcode technology. A pilot application in Jilin province assisted local supervisors in carrying out regulatory work on FSEs, which proved the feasibility of smart supervision. This study can be used as an example for food safety supervision in other regions, and it can assist other governments that wish to implement similar policies to ensure food safety in their countries.}

In this paper, we present the first framework, AudioAcc, to help evaluate the performance of various accents. AudioAcc takes in videos from YouTube and generates composite commands. We further propose a new metric called Consistency of Results (COR) that developers can use to avoid the incorrect translation of the produced results by rewriting the skill to improve the Word Error Rate (WER) performance. We evaluate AudioAcc on complete sentences extracted from YouTube videos. The result reveals that our composite sentences generated by AudioAcc are close to the complete sentences. Our evaluation of diverse audiences shows that first, speech from native speakers, particularly Americans, exhibits the best WER performance by 9.5% in comparison to speech from other native and nonnative speakers. Second, speech from American professional speakers has significantly more fairness and the best WER performance by 8.3% in comparison to speech from German professional speakers and German and American amateur speakers. Moreover, we show that using the COR metric could help developers to rewrite the skill to improve the WER accuracy, which we used to improve the accuracy of the Russian accent.}

In this context, the present study tackles the environmental sustainability of a novel piezoresistive Smart Brick monitoring sensor, for new and existing masonry buildings. The environmental footprint of two brick prototypes is compared to that of a regular strain gauges-based monitoring setup in the frame of the ReCiPe evaluation method. Metals use can be pointed as hot spot. Results show that Smart Brick prototypes, due to their longer durability (considering 50-year’s lifespan), are associated to 50% lower damage oriented impacts compared to the traditional solution in a life cycle (LC) perspective. This result is critical towards large scale implementation of smart bricks, given that environmental impact of sensing systems is one of the major current bottlenecks that are still limiting the application potential of structural health monitoring technologies.}

abstract = {The transition of the energy system from fossil fuel towards renewable energy (RE) is rising sharply, which provides a cleaner energy source to the urban smart grid system. However, owing to the volatility and intermittency of RE, it is challenging to design an accurate and reliable short-term load forecasting model. Recently, machine learning (ML) based forecasting models have been applied for short-term load forecasting whereas most of them ignore the importance of characteristics mining, parameters fine-tuning, and forecasting stability. To dissolve the above issues, a short-term load forecasting model is proposed that incorporates thorough data mining and multi-step rolling forecasting. To alleviate the chaos of short-term load, a de-noising method based on decomposition and reconstruction is used. Then, a phase space reconstruction (PSR) method is employed to dynamically determine the train-test ratios and neurons settings of the artificial neural network (ANN). Further, a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) is applied to optimize the parameters of ANNs. Case studies are conducted in the urban smart grid systems of Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. Simulation results show that the proposed model can forecast short-term load well with various measurement metrics. Multiple criterion and statistical evaluation also show the good performance of the proposed forecasting model in terms of accuracy and stability. To conclude, the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness, which will provide references to RE transitions and smart grid optimization, and offer guidance to sustainable city development.}

In this regard, it is important to ensure the advancement of the ontology for distributed energy systems using existing CIM standards and various extensions that include entities specific to the domain of decentralized energy. The paper describes an approach to the formation of the ontology of smart distributed energy systems, assesses the possibility of using existing ontologies to extend CIM, and considers the matter of integrating a CIM-based ontology with other domain ontologies. A description of an ontology update process is presented, which ensures the maintenance of the ontology in a form that corresponds to the needs of the digital platform stakeholders.

The classical data sampling approach is of time invariant nature. Thus, it includes in the acquisition, transmission, and processing stages a large amount of redundant data. This deficit can be eliminated by employing the event-driven sampling. It provides a real-time data compression. Therefore, a novel event-driven adaptive-rate sampling approach is utilized for the data acquisition and features extraction.

It is possible for any Electric Vehicle (EV), charging station (CS), or other components to be compromised, and they can infect other stations too. This problem can damage even the central infrastructure. We can prevent the spread of attacks by isolating the high-risk stations. Researches in this area have not considered the availability of charging infrastructure, and they only tried to reduce the speed of threat propagation. EV battery capacity is limited, and they need charging at several stations during a trip. So availability of specified stations along the route to recharge the vehicles is critical. We first present a model that minimizes security risk and maximizes the availability of the stations. Second, we propose another model for EVs itinerary planning that detects the best plans according to their status, system topology, and threat level of stations. Our model is used to minimize the outage probability of stations and infection propagation speed in peak time. This model also reduces the tour time of the EVs. The analysis shows the performance of the proposed approach in maintaining the availability while reducing the spread of the infection and optimizes suggested paths to EVs.}

The efficiency of evacuation can be enhanced by integrating the internet of things, fog computing, cloud computing, and other communication technologies. In this study, we present an intelligent evacuation system that combines Internet of Things (IoT), fog layer, and cloud layer. First, this system applies IoT technologies to capture environmental information, and the location of occupants to track their movements. Second, the Fog layer is employed to detect emergency events using Support Vector Machine (SVM), perform real-time Spatio-temporal processing based on the data collected, and dimension reduction with the energy-saving mechanism. Third, the Cloud layer facilitates an evacuation algorithm to compute a fast and safe route using environmental and occupant information gleaned from the fog and generate an evacuation map to direct evacuees to the exit. Our model considers the current location of evacuees as well as environmental information gained from intelligent building sensors and personal mobile platforms to recommend the optimal evacuation route for each traced evacuee. The results of simulations show that our framework can efficiently and accurately guide evacuees to a safer location while significantly reducing direct fire exposure. Further, performance parameters are evaluated by comparing fog-cloud deployments and cloud only deployments for more clarity. This study acknowledges that the proposed paradigm is efficient in utilizing IoT devices, fog, and cloud services to build an energy-efficient, cost-effective, and scalable evacuation platform for smart building advancements.}

abstract = {Smart green buildings (SGBs) are composed of numerous services and offer hopeful solutions to the world's continuous and rapid urbanization. Conventional data transmission systems are insufficient to deliver acceptable services because to the sudden surge in high-quality information transmission requirements over long distance for numerous linked residents in SGBs. Consequently, a hybrid next generation passive optical network (NGPON) along with visible light communication (VLC) indoor/outdoor broadcast network is presented in this work to increase the reliability with intelligence, exalted overall efficiency, cost efficiency, and security of SGBs. Bidirectional PON-VLC system incorporates the time and wavelength division multiplexing (TWDM), wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) techniques. In order to improve system performance, various OCDM codes are used in this work at 10/2.5 Gbps per channel throughput via fiber-VLC channels. According to the simulation results, the modified new zero cross-correlation (MNZCC) code performs better than previous codes and supports 200 active residents at reliable 100 km fiber along with 5 m VLC range. Furthermore, by expanding the received aperture diameter to 25 cm, VLC coverage may be increased till 10 m. Moreover, it provides adequate receiver sensitivities of − 13 to − 12 dB in uplink with − 9.8 to − 6 dBm in downlink for 200 to 600 fields of view angles compared to 00 view angle having sensitivity of − 15 dBm. Additionally, the numerical analysis and comparison performance show that PON-VLC outperforms fiber-VLC link-based scenarios when it comes to noise and channel impairments.}

Completed self-administered questionnaires were obtained from 372 respondents who had used the smart facilities. The findings through the SEM (structural equation modeling) method revealed that physical and psychological stimuli had positive effects on arousal levels and tourist experiences and arousal level was a moderator between environmental stimuli and tourist experiences.

Next, the main grid operator announces the required flexibility capacities to RBMGs and IESHs so that they can re-plan with the possibility of participating in flexibility markets.

The implemented metering device has been comprised of isolated measurement transducers for detecting the current and voltage rates of sources and various types of loads either in a microgrid or smart home application. The signal conditioning tier has been comprised of highly accurate and sensitive operational amplifiers, and signal processing has been accomplished by a PIC microcontroller which is capable to interface USB and ZigBee based wireless communication protocols. The processed measurement data have been transmitted with wireless communication, and a graphical user interface (GUI) software has been coded at the receiving end host computer.

abstract = {The real estate sector brings a fortune to the global economy. But, presently, this sector is regressive and uses traditional methods and approaches. Therefore, it needs a technological transformation and innovation in line with the Industry 4.0 requirements to transform into smart real estate. However, it faces the barriers of disruptive digital technology (DDT) adoption and innovation that need effective management to enable such transformation. These barriers present managerial challenges that affect DDT adoption and innovation in smart real estate. The current study assesses these DDTs adoption and innovation barriers facing the Australian real estate sector from a managerial perspective. Based on a comprehensive review of 72 systematically retrieved and shortlisted articles, we identify 21 key barriers to digitalisation and innovation. The barriers are grouped into the technology-organisation-external environment (TOE) categories using a Fault tree. Data is collected from 102 real estate and property managers to rate and rank the identified barriers. The results show that most of the respondents are aware of the DDTs and reported AI (22.5% of respondents), big data (12.75%) and VR (12.75%) as the most critical technologies not adopted so far due to costs, organisation policies, awareness, reluctance, user demand, tech integration, government support and funding. Overall, the highest barrier (risk) scores are observed for high costs of software and hardware (T1), high complexity of the selected technology dissemination system (T2) and lack of government incentives, R&D support, policies, regulations and standards (E1). Among the TOE categories, as evident from the fault tree analysis, the highest percentage of failure to adopt the DDT is attributed to E1 in the environmental group. For the technological group, the highest failure reason is attributed to T2. And for the organisational group, the barrier with the highest failure chances for DDT adoption is the lack of organisational willingness to invest in digital marketing (O4). These barriers must be addressed to pave the way for DDT adoption and innovation in the Australian real estate sector and move towards smart real estate.}

In our previous study, we proposed a “smart recycling system” that utilizes existing industrial facilities with higher energy efficiency so that a cost-effective and robust recycling system for treating municipal wastes can be established. In this study, we further develop the concept of smart recycling and propose a framework for facilitating the implementation of such a system. By making use of existing facilities and adopting both closed-loop and semi-closed-loop recycling processes, this system allows flexible adaptations on the changes of external factors. A spatially optimal scale is necessary to meet the requirements for such a smart recycling system. Thus, we develop an integrated model that combines both geographical information system based collection model and a process model for a smart recycling center. In order to test its applicability, we employ a case study approach to simulate the implementation of smart recycling in the three satellite cities of Tokyo Metropolitan Area and evaluate its effects under three different scenarios. Our simulation results show that smart recycling cannot only reduce carbon dioxide emission but also lower the overall costs. Also, by comparing with conventional waste incineration, we find that the unit cost of smart recycling is relatively stable to changes of the waste amounts due to its lower fixed costs for facilities.}

This paper examines the feasibility and consequences of such change in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand state in India, its impact on traditional cycle rickshaw pullers; and how they fit in the overall urban transport sector. This paper presents Passengers' and Drivers' overall experience of E-Rickshaws and Cycle Rickshaws in promoting last-mile connectivity. Data collected through in-depth interviews with twenty e-rickshaw drivers, twenty rickshaw pullers, and twenty passengers in Ranchi highlights the user experiences of e-rickshaw and advantages, disadvantages, as well as the effectiveness of e-rickshaw on the streets.

The Prospective, Multicenter Registry Assessing the Embolization of Neurovascular Lesions Using the Penumbra SMART COIL® System (SMART) is the largest prospective, multicenter, postmarket registry established to gather real-world experience on Penumbra (Alameda, USA) SMART COIL System, PC400, and POD embolization coils. The goal of this study is to report the technical success and efficacy of SMART COIL System coils in treating saccular intracranial aneurysms.
Methods
This subgroup analysis from the SMART registry included patients with saccular intracranial aneurysms treated using ≥75% SMART COIL System or PC400 coils. Baseline and procedural data, angiographic data, and clinical outcomes were collected. Predictors of catheter kickout, packing density, and postprocedural angiographic outcome were analyzed using multivariable regression models in saccular aneurysm cases.
Results
Between June 2016 and August 2018, the SMART registry enrolled 995 patients at 68 sites, of which 851 of 995 (85.5%) were treated for saccular aneurysms (mean age, 59.9 years). Aneurysms had a mean size of 6.8 mm, were wide neck in 63.1%, and ruptured in 31.0% of patients. Mean aneurysm packing density was 32.3%. Postprocedural Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) I–II was achieved in 80.3% of patients; smaller aneurysms, non–wide-neck aneurysms, and high packing density were predictive of RROC I–II. Overall, mean fluoroscopic time was 43.4 minutes, rate of reaccess attempts because of catheter kickout was 6.2%, and mean procedure time was 83.2 minutes.
Conclusions
SMART COIL System coils achieved good technical success and adequate occlusion in treating saccular intracranial aneurysms in a real-world setting.}

In this study, the effects of climate-smart managements on crop yields and GHG emissions during 1981–2020 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China were explored based on the APSIM crop model. Four cropping patterns and four fertilization measures were set according to the local planting experiences and existing research results. The results showed that proper fertilization management and effective cropping pattern were conducive to the improvement of total crop yield and reduction of GHG emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China. The total yield of winter wheatsummer maize (W-E) cropping pattern under F4 fertilization measure (400 kg·ha−1) was the highest, ranging from 26,088.82 kg·hm−2 to 31,430.62 kg·hm−2. Among the four fertilization measures, the GHG emission intensity of W-E cropping pattern was the highest, followed by winter wheatsummer maizeearly maize (10 days earlier) (W-M-ME10) and winter wheatsummer maizeearly maize (20 days earlier) (W-M-ME20) cropping patterns. However, the GHG emission intensity of summer maize (ME) cropping pattern was the lowest. As a whole, although the GHG emissions of ME cropping pattern were low, and the yields of summer maize were also low, which was difficult to ensure the local food security needs. As the traditional cropping pattern in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, W-E cropping pattern could ensure the need for high yield, but it also caused excessive GHG emissions in the soil. Comprehensively estimating the environmental effects and crop total yields, the W-M-ME20 cropping pattern was considered an optimal cropping pattern in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China at present or in the future. Our results have significant ramifications for local agriculture to adapt to continuous global warming as well as for enhancing studies on climate change's effect.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have dramatically changed the fundamentals of drug delivery, catalysis, and gas storage as a result of their porous geometry, controlled architecture, and ease of postsynthetic modification. However, the biomedical applications of MOFs still remain a less explored area due to the constraints associated with handling, utilizing, and site-specific delivery. The major drawbacks associated with the synthesis of nano-MOFs are related to the lack of control over particle size and inhomogeneous dispersion during doping. Therefore, a smart strategy for the in situ growth of a nano-metal–organic framework (nMOF) has been devised to incorporate it into a biocompatible polyacrylamide/starch hydrogel (PSH) composite for therapeutic applications. In this study, the post-treatment of zinc metal ion cross-linked PSH with the ligand solution generated the nZIF-8@PAM/starch composites (nZIF-8, nano-zeolitic imidazolate framework-8). The ZIF-8 nanocrystals thus formed have been found to be evenly dispersed throughout the composites. This newly designed nanoarchitectonics of an MOF hydrogel was found to be self-adhesive, which also exhibited improved mechanical strength, a viscoelastic nature, and a pH-responsive behavior. Taking advantage of these properties, it has been utilized as a sustained-release drug delivery platform for a potential photosensitizer drug (Rose Bengal). The drug was initially diffused into the in situ hydrogel, and then the entire scaffold was analyzed for its potential in photodynamic therapy against bacterial strains such as E. coli and B. megaterium. The Rose Bengal loaded nano-MOF hydrogel composite exhibited remarkable IC50 values within the range of 7.37±0.04 and 0.51±0.05 μg/mL for E. coli and B. megaterium. Further, reactive oxygen species (ROS) directed antimicrobial potential was validated using a fluorescence-based assay. This smart in situ nanoarchitectonics hydrogel platform can also serve as a potential biomaterial for topical treatment including wound healing, lesions, and melanoma.}

Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption, while windows are the least energy-efficient part of buildings. Conventional smart windows only regulate solar transmission. For the first time, we developed high thermal energy storage thermo-responsive smart window (HTEST smart window) by trapping the hydrogel-derived liquid within glasses. The excellent thermo-responsive optical property (90% of luminous transmittance and 68.1% solar modulation) together with outstanding specific heat capacity of liquid gives the HTEST smart window excellent energy conservation performance. Simulations suggested that HTEST window can cut off 44.6% heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption compared with the normal glass in Singapore. In outdoor demonstrations, the HTEST smart window showed promising energy-saving performance in summer daytime. Compared with conventional energy-saving glasses, which need expensive equipment, the thermo-responsive liquid-trapped structure offers a disruptive strategy of easy fabrication, good uniformity, and scalability, together with soundproof functionality that opens an avenue for energy-saving buildings and greenhouses.}

abstract = {In order to maximise European, national and regional research and innovation potential the European Union is investing in these fields through different funding mechanisms such as the ESIF or H2020 programme. This investment plan is part of the European 2020 strategy, where the concept of Smart Specialisation is also included. Smart Specialisation is an innovation policy concept designed to promote the efficient and effective use of public investment in regional innovation in order to achieve economic growth. The Smart Specialisation Platform was created to support this concept by assisting regions and Member States in developing, implementing and reviewing their research and innovation Smart Specialisation strategies. The Smart Specialisation Platform comprises several thematic platforms. The thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on energy (S3PEnergy) is a joint initiative of three European Commission services: DG REGIO, DG ENER, and the Joint Research Centre (JRC). The main objective of the S3PEnergy is to support the optimal and effective uptake of the Cohesion Policy funds for energy, and to better align energy innovation activities at national, local and regional level through the identification of the technologies and innovative solutions that support in the most cost-effective way the EU energy policy priorities. In the particular case of hydrogen technologies, the activities of the platform are mainly focused on supporting the new Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) initiative involving regions and cities. To date, more than 80 European cities and regions have committed to participate in this initiative through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding, and more participants are expected to join. S3PEnergy is helping in the identification of potential combination of H2020 funding (provided through FCH JU) and ESIF. To identify potential synergies among these two funding sources, a mapping of the different ESIF opportunities has been performed. In order to map these opportunities, Operational Programmes (OPs) and research and innovation strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) of the different European regions and Member States were analysed. The results of this mapping and analysis are presented in this paper.}

This research adopted case study methodology with four selected cases to explore the factors affecting CSCI in the SLEC and five factors affecting CSCI were identified. The research results indicated that factors including smart asset investment, multi-scenario service capability, and SLEC interaction have positive effects on supply-demand matching (SDM), which then positively promotes CSCI. Meanwhile, the results highlighted that the effect of personalized demand on SDM changes from negative to positive over time. However, personalized demand has a directly negative impact on CSCI. In addition to relying on the intermediary role of SDM, smart asset investment and SLEC interaction also have a directly positive impact on CSCI via enhancing consumers' interest in participating in CSCI and improving the operational efficiency of the SLEC.}

Examples of critical conditions may be natural-disaster events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and manmade ones such as terrorist attacks and toxic waste spills. Disaster events are often combined with the destruction of the local telecommunication infrastructure, if any, and this implies real problems to the rescue operations. The quick deployment of a telecommunication infrastructure is essential for emergency and safety operations as well as the rapid network reconfigurability, the availability of open source software, the efficient interoperability, and the scalability of the technological solutions. The topic is very hot and many research groups are focusing on these issues. Consequently, the deployment of a smart network is fundamental. It is needed to support both applications that can tolerate delays and applications requiring dedicated resources for real-time services such as traffic alert messages, and public safety messages. The guarantee of quality of service (QoS) for such applications is a key requirement. In this chapter we will analyze the principal issues of the networking aspects and will propose a solution mainly based on software defined networking (SDN). We will evaluate the benefit of such paradigm in the mentioned context focusing on the incremental deployment of such solution in the existing metropolitan networks and we will design a “QoS App” able to manage the quality of service on top of the SDN controller.}

The development and application of communication technology in the traditional power system deployed the SG cyber-physical system. The SG systems have a complex architecture that contains critical devices and Internet of Things (IoT)-based infrastructures. These critical infrastructures and devices are faced with cyber-attacks. Therefore, the SG systems required lots of research to protect these attacks from economic damage, security deficits, national grid security, and life loss. This paper comprehensively reviews SG cyber-physical and cyber security systems, standard protocols, and challenges. We discussed the SG model, key elements, advanced distribution management system (ADMS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), and advanced metering infrastructure framework (AMI). Then, we discussed the SG cyber-physical system communication standards and protocols. We present a correlation between SG cyber-physical system communication technology, standards and protocols, and application. Then, we thoroughly study cyber security principles, standards, and protocols. Finally, we discuss some challenges for SG cyber-physical systems, cyber-attacks, and cyber security systems and recommend some solutions for future research. This study provided a deep understanding of the cyber security systems and standards and proposed direction for future research in smart grid system applications.}

Previous studies on the effect of disruptions on passenger travel behaviour have mainly focused on shorter disruptions, while the few studies on impacts of long-term disruptions have had limited focus on individual passenger behaviour. This paper fills the gap in research by proposing a novel methodology based on smart card data for analysing the impacts of long-term planned disruptions on passenger travel behaviour. We use k-means clustering to group passengers based on their travel behaviour before and after the closure. We can thus observe how different passenger groups changed travel behaviour after the disruption. We compare these observations to a group of reference lines without disruption to account for general trends. Using hierarchical clustering of daily travel patterns, we are able to in-depth analyse the reactions of certain passenger groups to the disruption. We apply the method on a 3-month closure of a rail line in the Greater Copenhagen area. The results suggest that, in particular, passengers with an everyday commuting behaviour have decreased after the disruption. The proposed methodology enables explicit analysis of the impact of disruptions on diverse passengers segments, while the specific results are useful for public transport agencies when planning long-term maintenance projects.}

It has been more than a decade since automobile industries are into developing intelligent vehicles with a major objective of road safety. In order to warn or assist the drivers, various automobile manufacturers have been focusing on developing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, but not much effort has been drawn towards developing the smart infrastructure to supplement the development of intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for a smart vehicle monitoring system to provide smooth mobility of vehicles using roadside units such as streetlights. Such a system aims to eliminate the necessity of equipping each vehicle with smart sensors, which is typically an expensive scheme in most of the developing and underdeveloped countries around the world. This paper attempts to approach the problem of vehicle collision prediction by designing the system based on the concepts from science and engineering such as relative motion and vectors and implementing it using a machine learning-based model. These concepts led to the generation of datasets over which the prediction model was trained. The performance of the proposed model has been simulated using the software - Virtual Crash.}

In the era of big data, one crucial factor for the sustainability of smart cities is the innovation and economic value generated through open government data (OGD). Local governments often adopt incentive policies to encourage participation, recognizing that most emerging technologies are driven by innovation and promotion from enterprises. This raises a fundamental question: how do the strategies of local governments and enterprises interact in the context of open government data development? In this study, we have developed an approach based on evolutionary game theory to examine the interactions of OGD participants, such as local governments and enterprises, in shaping their long-term decisions. Specifically, we have explored the effectiveness and efficiency of combinations involving hybrid subsidies and data access fees by simulating Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS) based on empirical cases from enterprises. Our findings indicate that dual dynamic measures are more effective and efficient in encouraging stakeholder participation in open government data initiatives over the long term. The results underscore the preference for flexible policies over rigid ones and highlight the critical role of positive interactions between enterprises and local governments in fostering the sustainable operation of OGD.}

Because failure of civil engineering structures often leads to catastrophic consequences, the primary focus of all these design methods is the safety of structures while considering other aspects such as performance and resilience. With the economic growth, population increase and urbanization, as well as global warming and the depletion of natural resources, to meet the societal need for sustainable development, the construction of civil engineering structures also needs to consider sustainability, durability and smart lifecycle management besides safety, performance and resilience. This paper discusses the necessity, challenge and opportunity for the development of the next generation design of sustainable, durable, multi-hazard resistant, resilient and smart civil engineering structures, which are named as SDuMuRS. Five key aspects are identified for the construction of next generation structures including: (1) sustainability; (2) durability; (3) multi-hazard resistance; (4) resilience; and (5) smart lifecycle structural health monitoring and management. Critical reviews and discussions on each of these aspects are presented. Research directions are suggested accordingly for achieving these goals for the design of next generation civil engineering structures. While this paper tries to cover as much as possible in the review and discussion of these five aspects, it by no means is inclusive of the relevant studies, but sheds light on these important aspects and opens the discussions for the development of next generation design of civil engineering structures.}

Smart agriculture makes it possible to produce potato crops in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way for future generations. Smart farming practices are involved in almost all growing and even marketing processes to increase crop production and quality. Thanks to smart agricultural practices, it has become possible to increase the agricultural productivity of potatoes, to follow the development of certain parameters and to make appropriate decisions. As smart farming develops over the next few years, it will replace traditional farming methods and help narrow the gap between large and small farmers. With the technological progress, it has become possible to control the field situation and make decisions about the crop in real-time environment. Smart-farming may be applied to all processes of potato value-chain production including seeding, irrigation, soil monitoring and nutrients intelligence, harvesting, pest-disease-weed detection, quality, quantity, harvesting, and climate monitoring, forecasting and decision-making applications. These applications are capable to monitor, and define where, when, and how much variability is existent in a field and even take decision autonomously to manage it. In this chapter smart farming concept was emphasized and its difference from precision agriculture was explained. Examples of smart agriculture applications that take place in almost all cultivation and even marketing processes to increase potato production are given under Smart Farming Applications topic. In the last part of the chapter the potential of smart farming technologies for potato production was explored. The covered topics include technologies such Decision Support Systems, IoT (Internet of Things) and Sensors, Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geospatial Information System (GIS), Artificial Intelligence.}

This paper elaborates on those issues faced by researchers who are isolated from human-to-human physical contact in carrying out research in commercial agriculture, especially in COVID-19. Further, a conceptual model to connect and practice research beyond physical presence by digital transformations of organization design of research institutes under these circumstances is suggested. The framework proposed characterizes a connected lab complex – designated as the “Smart Lab Bubble”, to examine its potential in meeting the real needs of a researcher in a disconnected society to produce impactful research for the agriculture sector. It emphasizes the fact that this kind of model shall resiliently be adopted in technological sciences, with the backing from those non-technological sciences like economics, humanities, and management, to make the concept of a “society-friendly innovative research culture” a reality.

The global economy loses hundreds of billions of dollars yearly due to traffic inefficiencies, including accidents, pollution etc. We undertake an idea engineering exercise to propose a new concept of travelator roads for future sustainable transportation which has been unexplored for vehicular mobility and is thus the novelty of this work. The proposal offers a paradigm shift from static roads and provides a more generic solution than other advanced transportation technologies. It caters to various United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and provides a safer, self-sustainable, energy-efficient & environment-friendly solution for overcoming traffic violations, jams, road accidents etc. Travelator roads offer easy & quick installation for transportation in rugged terrains & congested areas thereby finding applications in diverse setups like defence, urban & smart cities. Design model and possible calculations are provided to evaluate it as a solution addressing various transportation-related issues. The research methodology in this work entails a review of the literature on current and contemporary transport technologies, followed by an idea engineering exercise to construct a new concept of Travelator roads from an interdisciplinary viewpoint. Further, we propose the application of Additive Manufacturing (AM) for adapting this concept into reality. An AM technology-based prototype for a travelator road can be manufactured to provide a better idea for its effective adaptation in transportation system because AM offers flexibility in design, the opportunity for shape optimization, simplicity in making modifications, shortened time to market, cheap capital needs. Due to material-efficient designs, less waste, and a decreased requirement for production tools, moulds, and dies, AM is projected to result in a significant reduction of raw materials and overall cost involved in actually realizing the concept of travelator roads for future sustainable transportation. Although, there are a number of potential technical issues with AM-based technologies, such as the durability of materials generated by AM for roads, the amount of time required to build sizable amounts of roads, and the upkeep and repair of these roads, which must be addressed.}

abstract = {In the acceleration phase of energy transitions, the role of community and citizen action is emphasised. The role of active, smart and experimental communities and individuals adopting novel practices and technologies is often contrasted with more conventional and mundane everyday practices, which change only slowly. In this context, the role of news media is central in disseminating information, mediating confrontations, and offering a space for shared societal frames on transition. This article examines Finnish media storylines on emerging energy technologies and practices in housing cooperatives, which manage most of the apartment buildings in Finland and thus have a key role in energy transition. Focusing on 17 years of development in three mainstream media, we first identify three main phases in media discourse intensity, focus and level of detail. Next, we analyse the ten main storylines on stabilising and reconfiguring the role of housing cooperatives in energy system change. Finally, we combine these storylines with cross-cutting societal frames on governmentalizing energy communities from the perspectives of technological anticipation, saving potentials and governance interventions.}

abstract = {Contemporary consumers have begun shifting their focus from product functionality toward the value that can be derived from products. In response to this trend, companies have begun using product service systems (PSS), business models that provide customers not only with tangible products but also with intangible services. Moreover, with the increasing use of smart devices, services providers can offer customized services to customers based on user-generated data with smart product service systems (Smart PSS). Despite extensive research on Smart PSS framework, few of these frameworks treated customer as an active data producer, which means producing data for the Smart PSS actively. Additionally, most of them proposed a general solution instead of a personalized one. To bridge the research gap, this study proposed a method that includes: (1) unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze user-provided data. (2) a recommendation system integrating deep learning to offer customers with personalized solutions. Thus, the role of customers is not only a service receiver but also an active data producer and forms a value co-creation process with service providers. A case study of tourist recommendation validate the benefits of proposed method. The main contribution of this research is to develop a personalized smart PSS method which could achieve a win-win situation for all players in this method.}

abstract = {With economic development in the world and growing energy demand, the concept of sustainable energy has received more attention from energy planners in different energy sectors. To achieve sustainable energy development (SED), appropriate utilization of all types of sustainable energy resources is vital. One further requirement for this is the integration of various energy systems in the framework of a multi-energy system where all energy system elements have the possibility of synergy with others for minimizing losses and maximizing the utilization of any availabilities. Further requirements for such a highly yet wisely integrated energy system (IES) have recently been specified in the context of smart energy systems (SESs). Smart energy hub (SEH) is introduced as a novel concept that provides a distinguished framework to model SESs. The main challenge for the modeling of SEH is finding the optimal design/sizing and operation strategy of the system components based on the uncertainty of renewable sources, demands, energy market spot prices, etc. Uncertainty modeling assists in reaching a realistic optimal approach in the decision-making process and thus is a promising line of future research in the modeling of SEH. The main aim of this work is to classify and evaluate the existing methods to employ uncertainty in the design, operation, and planning of SEH to reach a better understanding of future challenges in this way.}

abstract = {The “smart” behaviour that characterises commercial Smart Home systems is due to the relations that users manually establish between devices and actions through automation rules. Therefore, the intelligence of these systems is entirely (or mostly) predefined by humans. To address this problem, several Artificial Intelligence techniques have been applied in this field to try to improve the smartness of Smart Home systems by enhancing features such as self-adaptation, self-evolution and self-awareness. This work in progress article presents an approach to provide smart homes with these features through a reasoning system able to deduce, define, monitor and update the automation rules that drive their behaviour, in an autonomous manner and with a knowledge management at different levels of abstraction. That is to say, the rules normally defined by humans are now created and modified automatically. The proposal is based in a commonsense knowledge model that represents how the world works and enables to infer what resources can be used to accomplish a specific objective. Automations are generated according to general, commonsense and context (topology, users, sensors, etc.) knowledge, and they are more or less sophisticated depending on the available devices. The set of behavioural rules is updated when any of these resources change. Scone is the high-performance and open-source knowledge base system where the knowledge model has been implemented. Finally, to evaluate and demonstrate the potential of the model, a set of automation rules is built for a concrete use case. Results are shown in a virtual smart home on the Home Assistant platform.}

abstract = {The applications of smart structures with integrated piezoelectric elements have been expanding in the last few decades due to the abilities of such structures to withstand mechanical loads and operate as sensors or actuators using their electromechanical coupling. The available manufacturing techniques can result in uncertainties in the structure's geometric parameters, which, coupled with uncertainties in material properties, can lead to unexpected failures or unreliable performance. This paper presents a reliability analysis of a smart laminated composite plate made of a graphite/epoxy cross-ply substrate with a piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite (PFRC) actuator layer under static electrical and mechanical loads. A coupled finite element (FE) model was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics, from which nondimensional stresses and displacements were calculated. To investigate the effects of randomness in the material and geometric properties, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed and trained using generated FE data. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and First- and Second-Order Reliability Methods (FORM/SORM) were then used to shed light on the significance of considering randomness in the various material and geometric parameters and the effect of such uncertainty on the resulting nondimensional stresses and displacements. A coefficient of variation (CV) study identified the piezoelectric stress coefficient as the most significant contributing factor to the variation of all nondimensional parameters. Variation in the nondimensional parameters also increases under the application of an electric load. ANN-based FORM, SORM, and MCS all indicate a pattern of low probability of failure until a threshold value of about 3% of input parameter variation is reached, beyond which there is a rapid nonlinear increase in failure probability with increasing input parameter variation.}
