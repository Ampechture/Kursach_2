abstract = {Implementing cloud computing, big data, and Internet of Things technologies (IoT) extensively will make people' lives more convenient as information technology continues to advance at a rapid rate and encourages the establishment of new smart cities. The security nature of blockchain has more potential to improve the big data applications and services. The advancement of blockchain technology creates more opportunities for the development of smart cities. Blockchain plays the role to acquire, store, analyze, and preserve the privacy of the data. Building a big data platform for smart cities using blockchain and other emerging technologies can implement a point-to-point communication system, smart IoT, and government operations. This can also result in a more trustworthy trust agreement over time. Breaking down information islands and achieving the goals of sharing of data and information security using the blockchain and platform of big data creates a new kind of smart city. Cities which are making their move toward smart cities must take this important secure platform into consideration. To comprehend the issues that arise in the process of developing a smart city on a big data platform, it is imperative that the study and analysis of blockchain technology be strengthened in this connection. This article explores the benefits and related tactics of a blockchain-based big data platforms for smart cities.}

The aim of this article is to show the possibilities and directions of application of ICT tools based on abstract spaces and to present the current state of their application. The article shows which elements of GIS technology can be used in tools based on abstract spaces and what differentiates the discussed types of spaces. The approach to the proposed tools was made from three points of view. First - the types of abstract spaces were presented. Second - the areas of their application were indicated along with the application of higher information functions (such as spatial data collection for abstract spaces, their single- and multi-area visualisation, environmental analysis and assessment, planning, inspiration and support of decision-making processes presented in abstract spaces). And thirdly, they were framed from the point of view of modern technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), VR (Virtual Reality), AR (Augmented Reality) or hyperlinks. The reflections were concluded with an analysis of the current state of application of the technology in question in Polish public administration offices. The results of the surveys show that the proposed solutions are not currently used in city halls and are at the conceptual stage. The topic of AI is well known among the respondents. This is probably due to the popularity of the concept in popular science publications. Respondents show much less interest in the area of abstract spaces. Furthermore, they are of the opinion that their GIS solutions do not support this type of space, or if they do, they have no idea how to use it.}

abstract = {Smart cities are rapidly becoming the main form of urban development initiated in response to calls to address certain ills such as unsustainable cities. Often presented as rational responses to such challenges, there are affective dimensions which are political and impact their development in various places. We investigate these affective dimensions by using the concept of atmospheres -collective affects arising from encounters between places, actors, materialities and (hi)stories. Our work builds on the premise that acceptance of smart city initiatives relies on their supporter’s ability to disseminate compelling stories about smart urban futures. Atmospheres matter here because the stories that can be credibly told are not arbitrary – to be believed, urban stories must be embedded in and coupled to the materialities and affects of their environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the deliberate cultivation of atmospheres by actors with urban remits, revealing how such atmospheres can become impactful mechanisms for selectively rendering cities amenable or refractory to different stories about smart urban futures. An in-depth case study of the English new town of Milton Keynes is presented to illustrate how atmospheres have been cultivated to selectively resist or reinforce the stories through which the smart city agenda is advanced. Narratives about rationality and data-driven efficiency were translated into specific versions of the future. The resulting encounters gave rise to atmospheres of reception, anticipation, innovation and progress through which urban spaces were rendered selectively receptive to specific forms of smart development in pursuit of local, contextually defined goals.}

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.}

abstract = {A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical process, person, place, system or device. Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.}

We developed a global database of 50 smart city projects and used descriptive analysis to describe them. We gathered information about the projects’ size, ownership, geographic focus, smart city solution type, dimension, and the relationship with climate change. The four key directions of smart transportation projects are promoting sustainable travel behavior, smart parking management, public transit development, and active and low-carbon transportation development. The four key directions of smart governance projects are promoting participation, public services, and openness. Some smart city initiatives use smart lighting, low-carbon building materials, and electric vehicles (EVs) to save energy. Finally, smart cities have prioritized water resource management, intelligently establishing initiatives to manage water supply systems, consumption, and wastewater disposal.}

abstract = {Owing to some special characteristics and features, blockchain is a very useful technique that can securely organize diverse devices in a smart city. It finds wide applications, especially in distributed environments, where entities such as wireless sensors need to be certain of the authenticity of the server. As contemporary blockchain techniques that address post-quantum concerns have not been designed, in this study, we investigate a blockchain in the post-quantum setting and seek to discover how it can resist attacks from quantum computing. In addition, traditional proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols such as Bitcoin cannot supply memory mining, and the transaction capacity of each block in a blockchain is limited and needs to be expanded. Thus, a new post-quantum proof of work (post-quantum PoW) consensus algorithm for security and privacy of smart city applications is proposed. It can be used to not only protect a blockchain under a quantum computing attack compared to existing classical hash-based PoW algorithms but also to supply memory mining. Meanwhile, an identity-based post-quantum signature is embedded into a transaction process to construct lightweight transactions. Subsequently, we provide a detailed description on the execution of the post-quantum lightweight transaction in a blockchain. Overall, this work can help enrich the research on future post-quantum blockchain and support the construction or architecture of emerging blockchain-based smart cities.}

With the aim to grasp ideology behind the technological optimist rhetoric about smart city and research its effects and functions, an interpretative analysis of empty signifiers was conducted. Interpretations of Horkheimer and Adorno, Žižek and Lacan serve as background for the research, which are introduced to enrich an existing (mainly Foucauldian) set of smart city critique. Inspired by critical theory, this analysis shows that ideology is reproduced by culture industry and indicates tendencies to implement instrumental reason, to harmonize the existing social and economic contradictions and mainly reproduces economic interests. Since the researched rhetors are as politicians in power to materialize their ideological convictions, the mystification of technology plays a crucial role as disciplining and controlling measure, which aims to stabilize and justify status quo and maintain the existing inequalities. Derived rhetoric elements, which indicate categorization of citizenship and reductionism of environmental issues demonstrate the high societal relevance of the study and emphasize the urgent need for critique on progressing urban digitalization.}

This is particularly prevalent in smart city contexts where initiatives concerning, for example, energy efficient buildings and smart energy grids drive new kinds of ecosystem formation. Orchestrating emerging innovation ecosystems can offer a path to sustained competitive advantage for ecosystem leaders. Yet, it calls for the development of new capabilities to sense, seize, and reconfigure digitalization opportunities in a highly dynamic ecosystem environment. Yet, prior research lacks insights into the dynamic capabilities and routines required for ecosystem innovation. Therefore, this study investigates how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to orchestrate ecosystem innovation and, thus, gain from it. Through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation. We develop a capability-based framework demonstrating three orchestration mechanisms – namely, configuring ecosystem partnerships, value proposition deployment, and governing ecosystem alignment. Our findings carry implications for the literature on innovation ecosystems and dynamic capabilities, as well as for managers.}

Secondly, we describe the opportunities fueled by LocBigData for the realization of smart cities, mainly via answering questions ranging from “what happened” and “why did it happen” to “what's likely to happen in the future” and “what to do next”. Thirdly, pitfalls of dealing with LocBigData are summarized, such as high volume/velocity/variety; non-random sampling; messy and not clean data; and correlations rather than causal relationships.

Control systems based on network models of local positioning partially solves the problem of a safety motion. The paper emphasizes three main categories of UV software systems providing correspondingly, collection and processing data, planning, and control, as well as an approach to the architecture of decision making for UV, based on networking and computational multilevel analytics.

abstract = {Smart city projects stand out for including a wide array of communication systems and heterogeneous technologies operated by multiple entities that collect data from citizens in very different ways. Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.}

This research studies the current delivery of strategic smart city agendas as well as current means to measure and present their performance and proposes a method that uses blockchain to reimagine both in a more empowering and collaborative manner, the so-called People's Smart City Dashboard (PSCD). The thesis of this research is that smart city agendas have failed in their promise of being citizen-centric instruments and this is due to their top-down approach. This can be reversed by using community-led technologies such as blockchain. However, this bottom-up and blockchain-based implementation of smart city agendas will require from new, people-centric measurement tools and thus the so-called Activators and Aggregators are designed as well.}

abstract = {Digital technology has enabled the emergence of smart homes, which promise to provide occupants with a high-quality life while being environmentally friendly. However, occupants’ demand for “comfort” and “convenience” may contradict the purpose of minimizing the carbon footprint of smart homes. Investigating whether smart home adoption can reduce carbon emissions and promote carbon neutrality from a consumer perspective is therefore essential. In this study, 359 valid responses were collected from Hangzhou, a Chinese megacity, as basic data. We established a smart home adoption evaluation index system that enabled us to empirically examine the trend of household electricity-related CO2 emissions with the change in smart home adoption level. We found an inverted U-shaped relationship between the smart home adoption level and household electricity-related CO2 emissions. Smart home adoption causes more CO2 emissions in the initial stage, but reaches a tipping point where higher levels of smart home adoption leads to widespread use of energy-saving smart features and subsequently fewer emissions. Furthermore, this study confirmed the moderating effect of the internet divide on the relationship between smart home adoption and electricity-related CO2 emissions; the results indicate that improving internet accessibility and utilization promotes the commitment to reducing CO2 emissions in smart homes.}

The aim of this descriptive review was to systematically investigate peer-reviewed publications focused on SC research in SEE in order to present the findings and the state-of-art in this research domain. Seventy-four papers were thoroughly studied, analysed and classified based on their focus on SC themes and common sub-themes. While smart governance had been studied extensively in the SEE region, topics related to the smart economy and smart people received low attention from researchers. Mapping the selected papers to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle showed that SC research in SEE is still in the conceptualising and planning stages, with very little evidence from the real implementation and follow-up activities. From the stakeholders’ perspective, the focus is on the institutional point of view as most of the papers present their findings in relation to (national or local) government bodies or policies, without balancing with corresponding businesses’ or individuals’ (users’) point of view. In general, user involvement was found to be very low in regards to current SC research in the SEE region.}

abstract = {A Sustainable Smart City (SSC) has become the largest industrial sector that encompasses advanced cognitive, information, and computing methods for providing better big data handling to enhance the quality of life and urban operations with optimized resource utilization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as Air Taxis (ATs) in SSC, bypassing traffic congestion. However, the integration of ATs in SSC is very challenging, seeking high safety and security for the passengers. Such an autonomous system carries vital information, becoming vulnerable to furtive False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA), which have not received considerable research attention heretofore. To address the problem, this article establishes a model-free FDIA employing a recurrent deterministic policy gradient to exploit the data integrity of AT’s sensors, leading to collisions. Thereafter, a decentralized threat detection model, a deep optimized attentive federated aggregation learning is deployed, to counteract the threat and protect the data privacy of each AT. The suggested method is parallelizable and can accurately detect an unobservable FDIA in a distributed manner. The simulation findings show that the proposed attack–defense model investigates in-depth system’s vulnerabilities and tackles the risk with a higher detection rate and reduced computing cost while maintaining privacy preservation that surpasses modern approaches.}

abstract = {The development of smart city and smart mobility has put forward requirements for the traffic zone division. The traditional traffic zone division is limited by data with low update frequency and low accuracy, which can hardly meet the needs. With the progress of ICTs, data-driven traffic zone division is developing gradually. Many scholars have tried to divide traffic zone through GPS and CDR. However, there are still shortcomings in the data-driven traffic zone division. On the one hand, different scholars use different data sources and division methods, and there is no unified framework that can describe different ways. On the other hand, many technical problems such as unsatisfactory zone boundary, single data source and clustering algorithm only considering similarity have not been solved well. Therefore, this paper first proposes a technical framework for data-driven traffic zone division, which describes the different methods uniformly by dividing the data-driven traffic zone division into four parts. Based on this framework, this paper proposes a traffic zone division method based on CSD, which solves the above technical problems successfully, and finally is applied in the traffic zone division of Foshan, China.}

It is achieved by balancing the data transmission, energy consumption, and conservation optimally. In this article, the learning assisted efficient energy harvesting method is proposed for improving the energy efficiency of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed in the smart city environment. The regression learning model used in this proposed method classifies the time and energy-dependent schedules for data queuing and transmission in a view to maximising throughput. Cost-based data transmission and energy harvesting approaches are the concurrent procedures used to identify the linear descent points through the regression method. This identification helps mitigate unnecessary energy dissemination and early energy drain of the IoT devices for their allocated/transmitted data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations, and it is verified using the metrics energy consumption, remaining energy ratio, energy harvested, cost factor, and throughput. The proposed method helps to minimise the energy consumption rate and maximise the throughput in an effective manner.}

Social media applications provide an opportunity for dialogic communication, where, for a relatively low cost, a large amount of information reaching a wide audience can be published and exchanged in real time, fueling opportunities for citizens' engagement. This study is based on a social media listening method, through Twitter data mining, which enabled disentangling different components of citizen engagement (popularity, commitment, and virality) for a sample of Italian municipalities. In addition, we executed a deep analysis of the types of communication artifacts exchanged and, through a content analysis of the tweets published by followers of the municipalities' accounts, we identified the main areas of interest in the social media conversations. Our results are based on the analysis of online conversations engaged by followers of Twitter accounts of a sample of 28 Italian municipalities, chosen among the most active and densely populated. We show that municipalities tend to use the Twitter account as a channel of communication to inform the population about a variety of topics, such as transport and public works, among the others. The volume of activity and number of followers (audience) vary from one municipality to the other. There is generally a negative relationship between the density of the population of a municipality and citizens' engagement: smaller municipalities show a higher citizens' engagement; the biggest ones, like Roma, Milan, Turin, Naples, are laggards. We finally conducted a city profiling process, which provides a representation of key citizens' segments in terms of engagement. Policymakers could find in our work useful tools to increase citizens' listening capacity.}

In the last few years, several techniques and models are used for retrieving significant information from urban big data of smart cities. This research work aims at developing a data fusion-based traffic congestion control system in smart cities using a deep learning model.
Methodology
A hybrid model based on the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) architectures are used for region-based traffic flow predictions in smart cities. CNN is used for the classification of spatial data while LSTM for temporal data.
Conclusion
The experiments used the CityPulse Traffic and CityPulse Pollution datasets, and measured root mean square error (RMSE), time consumption and accuracy. A small RMSE value of 49 and highest accuracy of 92.3% compared to other baseline models depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the region-based traffic flow prediction problems in the smart cities.}

This paper presents a co-designed tool with academic and local authority partners to demonstrate the ecosystem service benefits of small-scale urban green infrastructure projects. Through the tool, users can readily assess the impact of green infrastructure investments on the delivery of a selection of ecosystem services in the early stages of a project. Furthermore, the tool provides a standardised assessment of cultural ecosystem services’ contributions, as well as offering a method to score spatial designs on the impact on habitat for biodiversity. Use of the tool is demonstrated using a pilot study in Kapelle, the Netherlands. The results set out an overview of the impacts of the spatial design on estimated ecosystem service delivery. They also show the tool’s potential to add value in early project stages and as a planning and design tool, helping to maximise the benefits that can be achieved through green infrastructure design. Complementing these arguments with ball-park estimations on green infrastructure costs, the Nature Smart Cities Business Model aims to offer public sector officers the means to create a business case for green infrastructure measures, facilitating the translation from strategies to actual plans, thus benefitting green infrastructure implementation in the public realm.}

With the continuous expansion of the scale of the Internet of things data center, the energy consumption of the data center is increasing, which greatly limits the development of the Internet of things data center. Energy consumption of Internet of things network data center in China's smart city has increased year by year, and data center network energy conservation has become a current research hotspot. The traditional network nodes are distributed and centralized innovatively to complete centralized control, and the controller completes the collection of the whole network information, the maintenance of network status, the distribution of flow entry, etc. Firstly, the energy-saving model of digital center network and the model data center network traffic prediction algorithm based on the principle of high accuracy traffic prediction are constructed, and an energy-saving multi-layer virtual traffic scheduling algorithm is proposed. Secondly, the two algorithms are fused, and finally an empirical study is carried out. The results show that in Random mode, the energy consumption ratio of energy-efficient multi-layer virtual-software defined networking (EMV-SDN) is the lowest, and the maximum reduction of energy consumption ratio reaches 7.8% compared with equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) algorithm. In Staggered mode and Stride mode, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest. Compared with the actual data flow, the prediction result of K-means-support vector machine (KM-SVM) algorithm is closer to the actual result, and the maximum error between the predicted value and the actual value of KM-SVM algorithm is 1.2 ​Gbps. However, the maximum error of balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies-support vector machine (B-SVM) algorithm reaches 3.1 ​Gbps; the prediction accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm is always higher than that of B-SVM algorithm in both discontinuous data flow and continuous actual data flow; the accuracy of KM-SVM algorithm in different experiments is high; among the energy consumption ratios of the combined algorithm, the energy consumption ratio of EMV-SDN algorithm is the lowest under the three communication modes, and the performance of the algorithm constructed in this study is higher than that of other algorithms in simulation operation; when the traffic prediction algorithm is combined with the virtual topology energy conservation control algorithm, the network structure change is reduced and the network stability is increased in this study. In the delay comparison of EMV-SDN algorithm, ECMP algorithm, and Dijkstra algorithm in the three communication modes, the EMV-SDN algorithm has the best performance. The results of this study provide an improvement direction for the development of Internet of Things technology and the construction of smart cities.}

Modern-day signal processing techniques are widely reliant on adaptive filters for efficient applications like signal prediction, echo cancellation, noise cancellation, etc. In this work, the use of adaptive filters is performed for stationary and non-stationary signals. It is well known that adaptive filters’ performance and effect depend on their regulating parameters and noise variance. Therefore, the parameter step size and filter orders are varied, and the outcome of the variations on respective signals is noted. Simulation of these scenarios is discussed at length to ensure better insight of adaptive filters to researchers and engineers to select the appropriate filter for a specific application.}

More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters. Simulation results carried out on real data from London's bike sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

Cities are consistently facing challenges like a growing population and old infrastructure. The Smart City dares to confront these critical challenges with smart and intelligent approaches to achieve optimized solutions for citizens. As a growing field of research, smart city assessment has already shown commendable success in many parts of the world and created a reasonable ground for further development. This chapter chronologically discusses the emergence of the smart city assessment concept and its evolution. It also examines various approaches that have been undertaken around the world, explains the basic principles followed by smart city assessment processes and, finally, looks at the connections between smart city assessment and climate resilience planning. This chapter reveals the salient features of smart city assessment processes to inform interest groups such as planners, architects, policy makers, investors, and the general public.}

ULLs aim to provide a space for different parties to research, develop, and test solutions to urban problems whilst engaging with local communities. Their experimental approach to urban innovation and to public-private collaboration makes flexibility, openness, and informality important. However, ULLs are also confronted with existing legal frameworks, responsibilities, and liabilities. Whilst they aim at shared decision-making and horizontality, they must navigate public and private interests, and interact with local government as well. To understand these dynamics, this article examines the legal and organizational structures of ULLs, the factors and trade-offs that influence it, and the role municipal government plays in in these structures. This article analyzes the different forms and trajectories of ULLs in practice, through semi-structured interviews held in four labs in Amsterdam. Through qualitative research, we found that 1) ULLs are partnerships that exist on a spectrum of formalization, from informal to highly formal; 2) the degree of formalization is influenced by financial, legal, and organizational factors that change over time; 3) each degree of formalization is associated to trade-offs, even if these trade-offs are not explicitly formulated by the people involved; 4) tensions arise from the municipality's double role as public authority and as partner. We conclude that ULLs could gain from clearly identifying the legal frameworks that condition their structure, actions, and future.}

Specific planning, operation, and thinking can address this problem with the Internet of things (IoT) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Existing research provides various solutions and methods for parking systems in the smart city. However, smart parking has many challenges, such as centralization, communication bandwidth, energy efficiency, integrity, security, and privacy. Inspired by Blockchain and AI technology, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Secure Framework for Energy-Efficient Smart Parking in Sustainable City Environment. The transport layer implements the ECC algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the parking zones data for secure communication. The RSU-based-Blockchain network offers authentication and verification of data at the security layer in a distributed manner. Virtualization technology is used for data storage and provides an energy-efficient environment using virtual machines. With Deep LSTM networks, we analyze the parking zone's data and offer the best parking space to the drivers with the best location and timing. We evaluate the proposed architecture using quantitative, qualitative analysis and provide the driver's best parking space.}

Multiple issues related to these concepts have been studied in the literature, and there are also many tools and indicator sets for assessing the smartness or resilience of cities, neighborhoods, communities, and projects. However, limited efforts have been made to probe interactions between smart cities and urban resilience. In particular, there is a lack of tools and indicator sets for assessing the contributions of smart city solutions and technologies to urban resilience. To fill this gap, in this chapter, we propose a set of indicators related to multiple dimensions of smart cities, namely, environment, economy, people, data, living, mobility, and governance. Overall, 98 indicators have been identified, and their potential linkages to resilience abilities are also highlighted and discussed. The proposed indicators can be used to develop tools for assessing the resilience of cities using smart city indicators. This could provide further opportunities for integrating the two concepts and contribute to developing resilient smart cities that facilitate addressing societal challenges, such as climate change, environmental degradation, and inequitable access to resources.}

The paper provides a perspective regarding the opportunity available in addressing the urban air quality management (UAQM) issues using smart city framework in the context of ‘urban computing’. Traditionally, UAQM has been built on sparse regulatory monitoring, enhanced with satellite data and forecast models. The ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, smartphones, social and cloud computing are reshaping urban conglomerates, worldwide. Cities can harness these ubiquitous technologies in concert with traditional methods for betterment of air quality governance and to improve quality of life. This paper discusses the role of urban computing in UAQM through a review of scientific publications and ‘grey literature’ from technical reports of governments, international organizations and institutional websites. It provides an interdisciplinary knowledge repository on urban computing applications for air quality functions. It highlights the potential of integrated technologies in enabling data driven, strategic and real-time mitigation governance actions and helping citizens to take informed decisions.

An ICT-enabled city is often referred to as a smart city. A distinction is made between "intelligent" or "smart" cities. It is a city that has been wired for information technology to be referred to as an "intelligent city." Sustainability is the ultimate goal of a smart city. As a result, performance analysis has become a crucial tool for planning and evaluating city development and projects, as well as assessing cities. City rankings are a hot topic right now, and people are paying more and more attention to them. New residents and investors alike can benefit from comparing cities. Aside from that, it can help cities assess their own strengths and weaknesses and devise development goals and strategies that will help them better fit into the urban system as a whole. Appropriate evaluation mechanisms and indicators are required for proper city comparison, requirement setting during planning phases, and project performance evaluation. This is also true when it comes to implementing smart city strategies and initiatives.}

In the context of Sharing Cities, an EU-funded programme aiming to deliver smart city solutions in areas such as citizen participation and infrastructure improvements of buildings and mobility, a prominent intervention has been the deployment and monitoring of a Digital Social Market (DSM) tool in Milan (Italy). The DSM allows cities to engage with residents and encourage sustainable behaviours by offering non-monetary rewards. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the DSM approach to promote active travel (cycling and walking) by analysing the data collected through the app as well as through participant surveys. Our model results show that a broader engagement with the DSM app (number of claps to posts, number of posts made, non-monetary rewards earned by participating in non-travel events) is positively correlated with the monitored level of active travel. Lifestyles, attitudes, and social influence also explain the variability in cycling and walking. This highlights the importance of investigating these factors when replicating such initiatives on a large scale.}

Most of them are indeed theoretical and qualitative approaches, providing scenarios that have not been applied to real cities/districts. Moreover, a comparison among the results of different quantitative planning models applied to real case studies is still missing. In this framework, the aim of the paper is to propose a new quantitative method based on a previous qualitative model developed by the same authors. The feasibility and validity of the method will be tested through the comparison with an existing AHP model and the application of both approaches on two real case studies, characterized by different territorial levels. Results of the analysis show that both methods are consistent, reliable and do provide similar results despite the differences in the application process.}

Learning from good practices elsewhere is a common approach for cities to initiate and develop SC policies of their own. Nevertheless, because of political, legal and cultural differences across countries and cities, policies will always be context dependent, and prosper under specific conditions. There is a vast literature on policy transfer and policy mobility, but much of it utilizes different concepts (i.e., policy translation, policy learning, and policy diffusion). Nonetheless, a critical omission they all share is limited concern for context-dependence and lack of prescriptive clues. Addressing both omissions would lead to a framework in which learning from good SC policy practices, formulating lessons, transferring them, and then adjusting them to fit the recipient's needs is taken up systematically in a stepwise manner. To develop a theoretical framework for Smart City adoption, this study brings together variegated existing literature under the heading ‘policy transplantation’ and synthesizes existing insights into a prescriptive procedure policymakers can follow. A systematic literature review is conducted to identify all key elements and sub-elements associated with SC policy transplantation, leading to a theoretical framework. This (prescriptive) theoretical framework is subsequently validated using an expert group and illustrated through a real-life case. The framework can be used as an analytical lens by researchers, but also constitutes a practical tool to guide policymakers aiming to use insights from good practices and implement them in line with their own contextual setting. Conducting contextual assessment before transplanting a SC policy is essential.}

We examine the consequences of integrating electric cars and buses into the city energy system (60% of private cars and 100% of public buses), using three different charging strategies in a modelling tool that considers local generation and storage of electricity and heat, electricity import to the city, and investments to achieve net-zero emissions from local electricity and heating in 2050. We find that up to 85% of the demand for the charging of electric cars is flexible and that smart charging strategies can facilitate 62% solar PV in the charging electricity mix, compared to 24% when cars are charged directly when parked. Electric buses are less flexible, but the timing of charging enables up to 32% to be supplied by solar PV. The benefit from smart charging to the city energy system can be exploited when charging is aligned with the local value of electricity in the city. Smart charging for cars reduces the need for investments in stationary batteries and peak units in the city electricity and heating sectors. Thus, our results point to the importance of sectoral coupling to exploit flexibility options in the city electricity, district heating and transport sectors.}

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of objects such as traditional computers, cameras, sensors and other things that are interconnected via a network to gather, process, and exchange context relevant data. Security is considered as one of the most important challenges facing IoT. Key distribution techniques are at the core of security provision and are critical components of any system in order to establish a secure connection between any two objects. In this paper a new Hierarchical Key Distribution (HKD) architecture and a set of Hierarchical Hybrid Key Distribution (H2KD) protocols are presented for IoT environment to support the provision of smart cities applications. The applicability of this protocols has been studied over HKD architecture and simulated using AVISPA tool and using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic. The targeted features of designing the architecture and the protocols are supporting mobility, scalability, heterogeneity and supporting constrained nodes’ limited capabilities. The performance of H2KD set of protocols has been evaluated based on a quantitative measure of several performance metrics including the memory storage, the computation cost for the constraint nodes, the number of messages exchanged and needed to establish a new session key for a mobile node. Scalability and resilience of the proposed protocols have been also measured. Simulation results show that H2KD protocols are safe against various attacks. Moreover, the analysis results show that the H2KD reduces communication, computation, and the storage costs for constraint nodes by 51.5% compared with related protocols. Additionally, H2KD has been found to provide more scalability and resilience than rival protocols.}

abstract = {While recognition of the dangers of extreme heat in cities continues to grow, heat resilience remains a relatively new area of urban planning. One barrier to the creation and successful implementation of neighborhood-scale heat resilience plans has been a lack of reliable strategies for resident engagement. In this research, the authors designed a two-week summer STEM module for youth ages 12 to 14 in Roanoke, Virginia in the Southeastern United States. Participants collected and analyzed temperature and thermal comfort data of varying types, including from infrared thermal cameras and point sensors, handheld weather sensors, drones, and satellites, vehicle traverses, and student peer interviews. Based on primary data gathered during the program, we offer insights that may assist planners seeking to engage residents in neighborhood-scale heat resilience planning efforts. These lessons include recognizing: (1) the problem of heat in neighborhoods and the social justice aspects of heat distribution may not be immediately apparent to residents; (2) a need to shift perceived responsibility of heat exposure from the personal and home-based to include the social and landscape-based; (3) the inextricability of solutions for thermal comfort from general issues of safety and comfort in neighborhoods; and (4) that smart city technologies and high resolution data are helpful “hooks” to engagement, but may be insufficient for shifting perception of heat as something that can be mitigated through decisions about the built environment.}

The blockchain technology plays an important role in achieving efficient smart cities. Blockchain technology performs transactions across a wide network between untrusted parties in chronological order and digital ledgers in a decentralized database. The decentralized architecture of blockchain offers greater security for distributed systems. Although, there have been some concerns raised about the robustness of blockchain technology. Numerous cybersecurity flaws have been found in blockchain implementations. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be more transparent than the old centralized systems. Hence, the blockchain technology has been exposed to numerous vulnerable cyberattacks. As a result, cyberattacks lead to system breakdown, data loss, password thefts, and information theft. This chapter analyses the various types of cyberattacks in blockchain-enabled smart cities.}

The main objective of this research is to propose a multidimensional assessment of cities from the aspects of a smart and sustainable city, through a sorting multicriteria analysis. Therefore, the model developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) was adapted and the FITradeoff method was used because it requires only partial information. The applicability of the proposal was illustrated by an application to Brazilian capitals. The results show that there is weakness on the part of the Brazilian capitals in relation to their access to and development of technology, innovation, local attractiveness and economic issues. Moreover, the capitals of the Northeast region of Brazil have lower performance compared to the cities of the South, Southeast and Midwest regions. Finally, this study can serve as a support tool in the decision process for managers, city planners and private sector entities seeking development strategies in relation to the theme, as well as helping to mitigate the gap found in the literature.}

Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.}

abstract = {Sustainable cities are currently undergoing unprecedented transformative changes in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.}

abstract = {With the decreasing cost of green technologies and the increasing ambitions to reach the net-zero carbon emissions target, more communities are engaged in renewable deployment and energy-intensive technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will be intensively adopted in the near future. The integration of these appliances in lower grid levels will likely require grid reinforcements. However, some of these appliances are flexible and there is an opportunity to explore their flexibility potential to optimise the investment costs further. This paper proposes an optimal design strategy for a grid-connected site that returns the renewable generation and storage’s optimal sizing capacities and the required network reinforcement capacity. The novelty of the work is integrating network upgrade costs and considering flexibility from distributed flexible resources across planning and operation. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer piecewise linear problem, with the capacities of generation, storage and network upgrade as decision variables. The piecewise linear cost function related to the upgrade costs figuring in the objective function is then recast as a mixed-integer problem, and the flexible resources are modelled through an approximation method as a single virtual flexible asset. The application of the strategy on the Perth West smart city project as a case study demonstrates the importance of considering flexibility in the planning phase. The costs related to the storage system can decrease by up to 76%, and the overall costs by up to 35%, with the highest levels of savings, reached for the highest rates of electric vehicle adoption.}

Since smart city initiatives are citizen-focused, public administrators must have strategies and plans for promoting citizenship as well as understanding how citizens use smart city technologies to develop sustainable smart city efforts. However, current knowledge of development and use issues relating to 311 system is limited. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence 311 system user behaviors with respect to the creation of citizen-generated data to help improve the management of citizen relationships. The results demonstrated that individual differences were viewed as a catalyst for user behaviors and have both a direct and indirect influence on such behaviors. These differences in views, along with technology acceptance theory and citizen-initiated contact theory, all emphasize the factors influencing citizen behaviors in 311 citizen-initiated contact and 311 contact channel choices. In addition, technology acceptance, satisfaction with the neighborhood environment, and frequent use of public services are characteristics exhibited by those who use 311 system more frequently. Significant evidence regarding the causal relationship between these three variables shows that 311 system is both service consumer-oriented and user-oriented and, as a result, reduces the gap between supply side and demand side in the adoption of governmental ICTs, which is viewed as a daunting challenge in the study of governmental ICTs and digital governance.}

Various congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging policies have been introduced in recent years. Nonetheless, the majority of these schemes emphasize penalizing the vehicles that opt to take the congested roads or charge in the crowded charging station and do not reward the vehicles that cooperate with the traffic management system. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic traffic congestion pricing and electric vehicle charging management system for the internet of vehicles in an urban smart city environment. The proposed system rewards the drivers that opt to take alternative congested-free ways and congested-free charging stations. We propose a token management system that serves as a virtual currency, where the vehicles earn these tokens if they take alternative non-congested ways and charging stations and use the tokens to pay for the charging fees. The proposed system is designed for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) in the context of a smart city environment without the need to set up any expensive toll collection stations. Through large-scale traffic simulation in different smart city scenarios, it is proved that the system can reduce the traffic congestion and the total charging time at the charging stations.}

In addition, an IoT based architecture allows the system to share data and diagnosis with a remote cardiologist in real-time or to store data in a FTP folder, as an Holter monitor, for post-processing and further analysis. The system consists of two sections: the digital one, based on the National Instruments MyRIO, digitalises the signal and processes it in real-time to make a diagnosis on possible occurring cardiac pathologies (bradycardia, tachycardia, infarction, ischemia); the analog section, which performs the acquisition, amplification, and preliminary filtering of a 3-leads electrocardiographic signal. The processing algorithm has been developed in NI LabVIEW environment. The main contribution to the state of the art is due to two removable and updatable memory devices. A first memory has been used to store clinical and personal data of patient so to configure the computing algorithm and adapt it to the monitored patient. A second memory has been used to store accuracy and uncertainty specifications of the ECG system in order to improve the reliability of the final diagnosis. The system aims to provide an electrocardiographic monitoring system for healthcare applications in the smart city context. The possibility to monitor constantly the patient health state at home is an important challenge of the next future smart cities. IoT and automation are the main aspects of the proposed system. Patients having chronic heart diseases need frequent hospitalizations to check their heart health. In this scenario, the proposed system is an Ambient Assisted Living solution developed to encourage the independent life of cardiac subjects by supporting his/her care and wellness during the daily life.}

Future cities are expected to be smart and billions of devices will be connected forming a network. The emergence of the Internet of Things proffers to link sensors enabled digital devices with the internet thus offering new services in the context of smart cities. In this regard, it is crucial for the internet service providers (ISPs) to observe/monitor their end-to-end network performance and identify any possible service degradation(s) as the goal of smart cities can only be realized through good quality internet. In this paper, we demonstrate our hardware-software co-designed quality of experience (QoE) management solution for ISPs. Our system is capable of monitoring and reporting the web, video, VoIP, IPTV, and WiFi QoE at various network levels. We experimentally tested our solution at appropriate network locations and demonstrated QoE and latency results for one of the leading ISP of South Asia. Our solution enables the ISPs to remotely monitor the quality of their network and identify any issue(s) which can lower the customer's QoE. As the internet is the backbone of smart cities, we believe our proposed solution for QoE will help expedite the smart cities’ infrastructure and solutions.}

Physical adsorption is caused by electrostatic interaction between the surface molecules of the adsorbent and the adsorbate molecules, which is characterized by adsorption without selectivity. Chemical adsorption is due to the chemical bonding between the two molecules, forming a strong chemical bond and also the surface complex. Chemical adsorption has the certain selectivity, generally monolayer adsorption. With the large increase in vehicle usage and the exhaust emissions from equipment such as oil-fired boilers, the pollution of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide gas has become an important issue in environmental management. Adsorption or catalytic conversion of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide is an important means of treatment. This paper integrates the smart city scenario to construct the novel scenario for the analysis and research. The simulation results prove the effectiveness.}

This paper introduces a novel Data Market Simulation (DMS) approach that assists data suppliers in the following: optimising vehicle-based supply of sellable data and creation of value from data; evaluating vehicle routes and the quality of data that the vehicles on these routes will produce; and reviewing how well the routes will serve the potential data users before beginning the supply of data in cities. The DMS approach supports iterative development and optimisation of routes and route parameters. If the goals are not achieved in the route plan, the data user can use the previous simulation results as a start point, develop the routes and route parameters in the simulation model, and then evaluate the updated route plan in simulations. The route development and simulation can be continued until the desired targets are met in the route plan. The DMS approach is evaluated in a small-scale experiment that simulated the use of autonomous busses and drones for the supply of parking space data in the LuxTurrim5G+’s smart pole pilot network in the city of Espoo in Finland.}

People use multiple scientific advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for big data analytics to enhance the integration and sharing of data and optimize the basic standards of smart cities. Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities.}

A smart city is characterized by the interaction between three conceptual components: technology, people and institutions assessed and developed through six distinct characteristics: economy, people, governance, mobility, environment and living. With the growing world population, the amount of clean and fresh water required in cities is increasing. Although water is part of critical urban infrastructure, many smart cities do not include smart water management in their visions. Hydroinformatics is the key link between smart cities and smart water management. It is a science that is not only about modeling and decisions support, but it also considers the social dimension of water cycle management, including social needs, concerns, and consequences. Hydroinformatics takes full advantage of the proliferation of remotely sensed information from space and ground-based sensors with increased capabilities in terms of spatial and temporal resolutions generated by the advancements in smart city technologies. Applications of hydroinformatics in the urban environment have increased in recent years. Smart cities technologies and infrastructures offer the potential of linking together all the aspects of the urban water cycle and can lead to the development of an integrated smart water cycle management.}

Although, many standard and conventional security solutions have been provided for IoT, it suffers from many privacy and security concerns. Standard security protocols are not suitable for majority of IoT devices because of its decentralized topology and resource-constraints. Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Adoption of conventional BC in IoT causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overheads which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. To mitigate these problems, this work proposes a smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient and secure as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, proposed BC has minimal overhead as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various processing nodes of IoT environment and detects relevant inconsistencies. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control. The primary goal of this research article is to explore the possibility of BC as an alternative to standard security solutions for low resource IoT applications.}

Surplus distribution is widely practised across the globe and there are several communities for the same as well. However, the success of these movements are determined by the active participation of volunteers. In addition, volunteer availability is an issue that is dependent on several different factors. An incentive module for the volunteers can normalize the availability of the volunteers. Such incentive modules are prone to identity duplication attacks and the implemented solutions do not really encourage volunteer hierarchical structures. In this paper, an incentive module that resists identity duplication and promotes the hierarchical structure between volunteers is presented. In addition, an improved matching module to match the food donors to the receivers utilizing the available volunteers optimally is also proposed. For the simulation, we have used real data taken from a real life smart city context, namely, we have used the OPEN DATA BARCELONA at https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/est-cadastre-carrecs-us and cast it to our simulation settings using Python libraries.}

Sustainable smart cities always looking for smart and more advanced systems. Smart healthcare is one of the prominent area and domain of smart cities where different types of applications are used for people's health and comfort. Smart health systems are further divided into different areas, such as e-health, e-medicine, personal assistant monitoring, and body area networks. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) is one of the popular research area due to its impending use in emergencies such as monitoring and diagnosis patient’s health. Sensor nodes are placed on or inside the human body where the implanted sensor performs the operations for a long time without any replacement of the battery. To avoid frequent change/replacement of the battery, energy management is essential and one of major concern. Facts show that most of the sensor networks use multi-hop and utilizes more resources. Energy-efficient routing protocols play a significant role in energy consumption. Due to the number of sensor nodes attached to the patient body, interference among sensors is one of the reasons for energy wastage. The co-channel interference increases the energy consumption because of the higher number of retransmission efforts required for successful transmission in the presence of interference. The main objective of this paper is to develop an Interference Aware Energy Efficient Transmission Protocol (IEETP) by utilizing the most appropriate routing metrics for smart health systems in smart cities. The proposed protocol selects the next forwarder node based on the residual energy of nodes, distance, node’s position, and node density. The proposed protocol is a multi-hop protocol in which each source node forwards the data towards the coordinator node. The proposed protocol has evaluated with state-of-the-art protocols where the IEETP has higher performance in the network.}

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of Environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) in three different well-established industries of three different volumes namely: food, glass and plastics industries. Material and Energy Flow Analysis (MEFA) using Umberto Efficiency + was carried out initially prior to LCA using Umberto LCA + to establish the inventory. The LCA has been conducted according to ISO 14040/14044 standards. Cradle-to-Gate system boundary was set considering the transportation of raw materials, energy and waste handling. Each case study is regarded as a sample representing the industry’s environmental burden respectively. The case studies are chosen with different production scale categorized under small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case representing the food industry which is considered a Small Enterprise proved to have a higher equivalent carbon footprint than the Medium Enterprise concerned with plastics recycling which points out the importance of performing LCA on all industrial scales.}

Detailed frameworks and techniques are consequently having to manual, operationalize, and degree the implementation manner in addition to the effect of the respective technology. This chapter discusses about blockchain era, a unique motive force of technological transformation that contains a mess of underlying technology and protocols, and its capability effect on clever towns. The chapter deals with the query of ways the blockchain era may also advantage the improvement of city regions. Based on a complete literature review, we gift a framework and study propositions. Nine software fields of a blockchain era withinside the smartization of towns: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and deliver chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) management and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) domestic, and (9) education are discussed. Contemporary-day tendencies in those fields illustrate how they're laid low with the blockchain era and derive propositions to manual destiny studies’ endeavors. Further sections of the chapter are well organized as follows. Section 1 is the introductory part of the eco-friendly blockchain technology for smart cities. Section 2 reflects types of blockchain executions and some common consent algorithms. Section 3 illustrates the benefits of blockchain combination with smart cities and reconnoiters ways it plays an essential role in creating and benefitting smart cities.

The changing dynamics of urban waste characteristics due to unplanned urbanization and rapid growth in urban populations (due to migration) has been a significant concern for local authorities in urban areas to develop an effective SWM plan. The development of a long-term SWM plan along the line of the government initiatives' objectives requires understanding the waste quantities, characteristics, and existing waste management practices. This paper presents an overview of existing waste management activities, financial and institutional demographics in six selected Indian Smart Cities, and the field studies to assess SWM systems as per the waste management rules. The study involved a participatory approach to collect data from local bodies and stakeholders. Indicative strategies for the development of waste management systems were formulated based on the outputs of this analysis. Discussion on pathways includes waste characterization, funding sources, data technologies, and service level benchmarking to plan an integrated solid waste management system for a Smart City. The outcomes of this study shall equip local authorities in designing waste systems to accelerate the transition towards innovative and sustainable waste systems.}

Different aspects of smart city assessment tools including scale of assessment, target groups, type of data, source of data, and geographical focus are studied. It is discussed that major approaches to assessment include benchmarking, baseline assessment, maturity assessment, assessment against peers, assessment against desirable targets, and scenario making. Currently, benchmarking is the most popular approach. However, depending on the specific needs of a development, other approaches may also be used to better inform decision making toward climate resilient cities. It is discussed that smart city should be evaluated at different levels and dimensions. There are six dimensions to cover all aspects of smart city including smart economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart data. Different indicators related to these dimensions are provided that can inform planners and policy makers in their efforts. The chapter argues that smart city assessment tools should be able to facilitate transition toward climate resilience. In this regard, our analysis showed that existing assessment tools are relatively suitable for informing planning and policy making related to environmental and social dimensions. However, better integration of issues and indicators related to other dimensions such as infrastructure is needed. We hope these will be further investigated in the future research.}

On the other hand, the temperature sensed by individuals is affected by environmental parameters such as the ambient temperature. So, considering the environmental parameters, it is possible to define the desired color temperature of users of an environment. In this study, regarding the ambient temperature as a parameter affecting the individuals' feeling of the color temperature of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), an innovative solution is presented. Results from the system simulation confirm the efficiency of this technique. The introduced method is recommended to adapt the LED light sources to the emotional requirements of inhabitants, especially in smart cities.}

However, due to its natural randomness, a large number of energy storage resources are necessary. Electrolytic hydrogen could quickly follow the fluctuations of renewable energy and transform excess renewable energy into hydrogen stored for future use, which not only promotes the accommodation of renewable energy, but also drives the low-carbon development of construction, transportation, electricity, and other industries, thereby helping construct future low-carbon energy systems (FCES). However, few existing studies have conducted a systematic investigation on the role of electrolytic hydrogen in smart city decarbonization from both the supply and demand sides. Here, we develop a full-life-cycle optimization model of FCES with photovoltaic (PV) and power-to-hydrogen (P2H) planning to achieve decarbonization goals in China. Our results show that the annual hydrogen potential of 10 selected cities with different energy structures and quantities varies from 0.236 to 9.795 megatons, with a gap of more than 40-fold. Considering PV and P2H integration in FCES, the CO2 emissions of 10 cities in related fields decreased obviously under an 80 % photovoltaic penetration level (PPL). Compared with electrochemical storage, P2H shows better performance in PV integration of FCES from both economics and CO2 emissions. However, this advantage needs to be based on diverse terminal uses of electrolytic hydrogen.}

This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning’s key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.}

The concept of a smart city is fast becoming a key instrument in transforming living environments in a better way to enhance the operational efficiency of a transportation system. This paper presents a framework to assess transportation performance measures and smart-growth of cities around the U.S. by including physical activity as one of the main criteria.
Methods
This study employs Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The proposed assessment framework is comprised of the evaluation of an individual criterion and the assessment of comprehensive results. The criteria are categorized into four groups including network performance, traffic safety, environmental impact, and physical activity. As a case example, the proposed performance measures were examined for forty-six cities in the U.S., and the required data was gathered from multiple sources.
Results
The output of the framework contains sustainability and smart-growth rankings of the selected cities as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to determine the quantity that each performance measure or weighting factor requires to alter the smart-growth score. It has been illustrated that the dominancy between reversible pairs in the ranking is critically sensitive for almost 15% of cases.
Conclusion
The results of the proposed framework can be an effective decision supporting tool in analyzing traffic management strategies. Results from the score sensitivity calculation indicate that the proposed framework can be adopted in multifaceted transportation system performance in sustainability and smart-growth of cities.}

Energy management of active power and frequency control approach is based on the intelligent probabilistic wavelet fuzzy neural network-deep reinforcement learning algorithm (IPWFNN-DRLA). The control strategy is formulated with deep reinforcement learning approach based on the Markov decision process and solved by the soft actor-critic algorithm. The NMG local controller (NMGLC) provides information such as the frequency, active power, power generation data, and status of the electric vehicle's battery energy storage system to the NMG central controller (NMGCC). Then the NMGCC calculates active power and frequency support based on the IPWFNN-DRLA approach and sends the results to the NMGLC. The proposed model is developed in a continuous problem-solving space with two structures of offline training and decentralized distributed operation. For this purpose, each NMG has a control agent (NMGCA) based on the IPWFNN algorithm, and the NMGCA learning model is formulated based the online back-propagation learning algorithm. The proposed approach demonstrates a computation accuracy exceeding 98%, along with a 7.82% reduction in computational burden and a 61.1% reduction in computation time compared to alternative methods.}

In her study of ‘Surveillance Capitalism’, Shoshana Zuboff cites Google’s parent firm Alphabet’s legal customer-purchase agreement for the parent firm’s Nest thermostats. These impose ‘oppressive privacy and security consequences’ requiring sensitive information to be shared through ‘Internet-of-Things’ (IoT) networks with other domestic and external devices, unnamed functionaries and various third parties. This is for data harvesting, analytics, processing, manipulation and transformation through digital re-sale to the same and other consumers in the form of unwanted, targeted advertising. The point of this identity ‘rendition’ is to massively augment corporate profits. It is but a short step from trapping the unwitting consumer in a ‘smart home’ to planning a similarly mediated ‘smart city’ aimed at further massively augmenting corporate profits. This is happening, as founders of digital media from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla either commission or become beneficiaries of ‘smart city’ planning. However, there is evidence that such imperiousness is increasingly countered by emerging democratic critique of these new ‘model villages’ or ‘company towns’.}

However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.}

To deal with this issue, we propose a new user authentication scheme in smart city environment using three factors of a legal registered user (mobile device, password and biometrics). The proposed scheme is shown to be robust against a number of potential attacks needed in an IoT-based smart city deployment. The simulation study for formal security verification using the widely-accepted “Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” tool demonstrates that the proposed scheme is also secure. Furthermore, experiments on various cryptographic primitives have been carried out using “MIRACL Cryptographic SDK: Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library” under both server and Raspberry PI 3 settings.

The purpose of a Smart City is to solve its inherent problems while simultaneously reducing its expenditure and improving its quality of life. Through the 4th Industrial Revolution technology, the advantages of Smart City are estimated to overcome the city’s expenses with city platformization. While a city traditionally is the subject of creation and not consumption, a Smart City currently is the key industry in generating more than 60% of its GDP in value creation from a production viewpoint. Moreover, with the expansion of online-offline convergence, cities can grow without limitation on its size, where connectivity and innovation determine the inclination of the city’s benefit-cost curve. As a city platform is responsible for connectivity, its value drastically increases through the 4th Industrial Revolution’s O2O (online to offline convergence) platform. When a city reflects on its own as a Digital Twin in the Cloud and when complete information becomes accessible through citizen’s participation through smartphones (Edge), Self-organization takes place, an ideal linkage between the city and citizens. Cities go through the self-organizing process of complex adaptive systems like the human brain. This research proposes a future model of a “Self-organizing City,” and suggests implementing the Smart City model based on the Smart City Tech-Socio Model in implementing strategies.}

Indeed, the rise of such initiatives serves as a sign of renewed attempts to experiment or innovate in designing urban futures in an increasingly urbanized and datafied society. In light of this, a number of alternative models of eco-urbanism have been proposed by scholars and promoted by policy makers. The prominent among these models are sustainable urban districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. At the core of these models is a range of compact and ecological design strategies and static and dynamic conceptions of spatial scaling. These are intended to produce and boost the benefits of sustainability on the basis of a set of integrated approaches—increasingly supported by big data technologies—as a way to overcome new challenges and introduce new solutions. Based on two case studies conducted on three of the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe—Stockholm, Malmö, and Barcelona, this paper analyses and discusses the role and relevance of integrating density, mixed land use, greening, and low-energy buildings to the sustainability of emerging eco-districts; the new conceptions of cities and their spatial scales in the context of data-driven smart eco-cities; and the opportunities and challenges of smart urban metabolism with respect to the evaluation of eco-districts. This study shows that combining compact and ecological design strategies improves the performance of eco-districts with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as paves the way for their balanced integration for producing synergistic effects. Also, this study highlights the innovative potential and enabling role of urban computing and intelligence in transforming the spatial scaling of data-driven smart eco-cities through generating the kind of designs that increase the effects of sustainability as outcomes of processes. Moreover, this study reveals the advantages of the data-driven approach to the analysis of the flows of resources in urban environments in relation to the evaluation of sustainable urban district development. This paper concludes that data-driven smart planning and evaluation holds great potential for facilitating progress towards achieving the goals of sustainability thanks to the proven role and untapped potential of big data technologies in monitoring, understanding, and analyzing urban processes and systems in real-time.}

The results of our analysis showed that, on average, more than half of the smart city indicators are covered by selected sustainability assessment tools. However, the extent of coverage was not the same across all dimensions. Dimensions such as smart environment and smart living have been better included in the sustainability assessment tools than the smart economy and smart people dimensions. CEDEUS includes the highest percentage of smartness indicators among the selected sustainability assessment tools, while LEED cities includes the lowest percentage. There is also no considerable difference between neighborhood and city scales of sustainability assessment tools in terms of smartness inclusion. Overall, the results of this research show that more efforts are needed for better integration of smart city and climate resilience indicators into sustainability assessment tools. It is hoped that the developers of assessment tools will consider this issue when revising their assessment tools.}

abstract = {Governance and decision-making in “smart” cities increasingly rely on resident-reported data and data-driven methods to improve the efficiency of city operations and planning. However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes.}

abstract = {With the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), the construction of the smart city came into being. Compared with the traditional city, a smart city can reduce resource consumption, improve energy efficiency, reduce environmental pollution, reduce traffic congestion, reduce potential safety hazards, improve the quality of life of citizens, etc. In order to collect a large amount of data to provide accurate decision-making recommendations for the management of smart cities, a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) system needs to be built as the basis. For most applications in smart cities, it is very important to obtain the physical location information of the data during the data collection. However, it is a challenging issue for most sensor devices in the IoT system, because sensor devices are hard to equip positioning equipment as limited by cost. To tackle this, a Low-Cost Physical Locations Discovery (LCPLD) Scheme is proposed in this paper. In LCPLD scheme, mobile vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for physical location discovery on the wireless sensor networks which are the important component of the IoT system in a smart city. In order to further reduce cost, we propose a task application mechanism to reduce the cost of vehicle broadcasting and the Adaptive UAV Flight Path Planning (AUPPP) algorithm to reduce UAV flight cost. In order to reduce localization error, the Large Error Rejection (LER) algorithm and the UAV Same Position Broadcast Repeat (USPBR) algorithm are proposed in this paper. After simulation experiments based on real vehicle driving data, the experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme: Compared with the comparison scheme, the LCPLD scheme proposed has a cost reduction of 16.58% ∼19.88%, an average reduction of 78.80% in positioning error, and an average reduction of 99.88% in the variance of positioning error.}

By extending MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Software), we design and test appropriate mitigation strategies when traffic accidents occur within an existing urban area augmented with V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) capabilities and Advanced Driving Assisted cars (ADAS). Further, we propose traffic congestion models and related mechanisms for improving the necessary time for emergency vehicles to respond to accidents.}

abstract = {Wireless communications for IoT in smart cities may be affected by Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation conditions due to obstacles such as buildings, trees, and others. LoRaWAN technology transmits information through several kilometers in one hop, from a source node to a gateway. However, packet reception decreases when the link has NLOS conditions and there are no alternative routes for packet delivery. This paper presents a LoRa implementation of MACGSP6, a Gossip-based routing algorithm, to improve communications in a LoRaWAN network where all nodes have NLOS conditions. The paper compares the packet delivery ratio of LoRaWAN and MACGSP6. Results show that packet delivery to the gateway increased from 0% with LoRaWAN to a minimum of 53% with the routing algorithm. Additionally, most packets were delivered using the shortest path available, even when the algorithm does not explicitly compute the routes, decreasing the delay associated with this process. Thus, the proposed solution is useful for IoT applications in smart cities, such as smart metering and structural health monitoring, where one relay node can forward the information of many other nodes.}
