abstract = {Despite the widespread implementation of policies tagged as ‘smart’, the concept of smart city itself still misses a solid and testable definition. Many scientific contributions used composite indicators to rank the cities according to their degree of smartness, often using un-robust methods and heterogeneous data. In this application we relied on statistical criteria to comprehend the principal components of smart policies. We used the environmental data coming from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat), describing the adoption of smart policies in the urban environment (ICT use, smart mobility, green innovation, sustainable governance etc.). The indicators, covering all the Italian chief towns (116 cities), have been normalized and classified in order to derive a taxonomy for the smartness’ domains. Rather than producing an overall ranking, the performances of cities have been analysed for each domain, with regards to the geographic location of cities. Northern cities show better performances overall. In order to investigate into the – Italian well-known – North-South polarization, we used spatial autocorrelations techniques to discover the localized clustering of cities with high or low scores. Belonging to the same administrative region and imitation effect are both possible explanations of the observed clustering.}

abstract = {Leveraging demand-side flexibility resources (e.g., buildings) is a crucial and cost-effective strategy for addressing the operational and infrastructure-related challenges in power grids pursuing deep decarbonization with high renewable energy penetration. However, the demand flexibility opportunities and financial benefits for residential space heating, which are sizeable demand-side flexibility resources, through emerging building energy management solutions (i.e., smart control and phased change material (PCM) thermal storage) across the US are not fully understood. In this paper, we systematically assess the demand flexibility and cost-saving/revenue potentials in residential space heating through detailed building-level simulations for five consecutive years at a 5-min temporal resolution in 20 metro areas across the high-heating-demand regions of the US. The results show a high degree of synergy between PCM thermal storage and smart control, which enables substantial demand flexibility potential, reaching 98.5% of peak load shifting, and electricity cost-saving/revenue potential, reaching 338.3% of electricity cost reductions, for residential space heating in the US. By achieving such performance, adopting smart control and PCM thermal storage is financially viable in 50% of the tested metro areas. The results reveal that the demand flexibility and cost-saving/revenue potentials of residential space heating in the US are further enhanced by higher volatilities in electricity prices. Active PCM thermal storage has lower energy efficiency but much higher energy flexibility than passive PCM thermal storage. Based on the findings, recommendations for integrating PCM thermal storage and smart control systems within residential space heating are provided.}

The Singapore government has realized the enormous potential of smart FM in developing a sustainable city and has implemented several initiatives to promote its adoption. However, the adoption of smart FM in the built environment industry is still in its early stage. Therefore, this study aims to (1) investigate drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM; and (2) explore whether there are significant differences in the perceived importance of the drivers, barriers, and strategies by designations and years of experience. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive literature review was first conducted to identify 6 drivers, 13 barriers, and 10 strategies. A survey questionnaire was designed and then validated by pilot interviews to collect data from practitioners in the built environment industry. Post-survey interviews were also carried out to validate the analysis results from the questionnaire survey. The study identified that increased energy savings, improved sustainability, and reduced downtime are the three most important drivers. Poor data management, high initial cost, and high cybersecurity risks are the three most important barriers. Development of technology selection mechanisms, improvement of smart FM system, and increased amount of funding are the three most effective strategies to address the challenges. Designations and years of experience have been proved to affect the perceptions of the importance of drivers, barriers, and strategies. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the drivers, barriers, and strategies in the adoption of smart FM, offering a starting point for organizations to consider its adoption. This study also enriches the knowledge of smart FM in the built environment industry with the expectations of facilitating the digital transformation and sustainable development of the built environment industry.}

The main goal of this paper is to create a fast emergency aid system for object detection in SME industrial premises. The basic assumption is that SMEs do not have any IT-trained personnel, and the solution has to be unsupervised edge computing. We use several off-the-shelf models of deep neural networks pre-trained for smart city applications, ready for online object recognition and edge computing. Our system works without any retraining, additional annotation, or human intervention. Specifically, we present heuristics for the automated creation of PGT (Pseudo-Ground Truth). Based on PGT, we can automatically decide which model is the best in the specific environment. We present an application of fully automated enhancing image capture camera outputs to smarter ones. We evaluate our system in a controlled experiment. Low-resolution cameras and large areas cause problems for our method. We present a proof-of-concept for improving our system even in these challenging situations. The benefit is a knowledge extraction in a simple and inexpensive way to expand the organizations’ databases with information from unstructured data from CCTV/IP cameras.}

The proposed method integrates the fire hawk optimizer (FHO) and Recalling Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (RERNN), commonly called the FHO-RERNN method. The major goal of this research is to continuously monitor data from IoT-based communication architecture and optimally manage energy in a SG system by decreasing the power bill, reducing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and obtaining the preferred trade-off among electricity bills and user inconvenience in a SG. The FHO-RERNN method is used to optimize the energy consumption of a SG system. The method works by first predicting the energy demand of the SG system using RERNN. Then, FHO is used to optimize the energy consumption of the SG system by scheduling the operation of its various components. By then, the FHO-RERNN method is done in the MATLAB software as well as associated to several existing methods. From the simulation, it concludes that the performance of the FHO-RERNN method is compared to the existing methods. The proposed method takes lower time and cost, compared with existing approaches. Thus, the PAR value performance is 0.3 while compared to BCMO-ANFIS, CFA, GA methods.}

The smart sustainable cities prefer a reliable IoT connectivity and data integration to meet the standard constraints of emerging computing paradigms with enabling techhnologies. The computing paradigms including cloud, fog, and edge are nowadays driving the technological advancement to enrich the features of the digital application (DApp) including interactive, intuitive, and personalized. DApp utilizes the essential characteristics of the enabling technologies such as heterogeneity, resource constraints, connectivity, and mobility to standardize the nature of smart intelligence via service agents. In the connection of massive IoT services, DApp involves continuous generation of IoT data over a dedicated gateway to offer extensive connectivity and improved access control. In the past, most of the existing mechanisms have primarily focused on security management for IoT networks to operate massive application services. However, a key issue of privacy-preserving for massive IoT is still challenging to ensure device protection. Importantly, the existing mechanisms fail to claim security efficiencies in terms of user anonymity and authentication key exchange using formal proof. Thus, this paper presents a seamless authentication framework with privacy-preserving (SAF-PP) protocol to deal with security and privacy issues of smart eHealth intelligence. The formal analysis proves that the proposed SAF-PP can adhere to significant security properties while improving the system efficiency rate. The performance analysis also shows that the proposed SAF-PP is more efficient in increasing the active users with an improved packet delivery ratio and network lifetime.}

abstract = {Spatial Data Intelligence (SDI) encompasses acquiring, storing, analyzing, mining, and visualizing spatial data to gain insights into the physical world and uncover valuable knowledge. These understandings and knowledge play a crucial role in connecting physical and virtual realms, such as in developing a City Metaverse (CM) aimed at enhancing and optimizing modern urban environments. The advancement of CM holds immense potential to benefit urban dwellers, making research on SDI an increasingly prominent area of focus. This paper contributes significantly by organizing the relevant research and technologies within a coherent framework. Firstly, we identify SDI technologies capable of collecting real-world information to construct a virtual CM. Subsequently, we delve into the technologies that can be compositely integrated with SDI to facilitate interaction with and management of actual cities from the virtual perspective. Additionally, we emphasize the effectiveness and potential of these methods in practical applications. Lastly, we conclude our survey by discussing emerging challenges associated with technological progress, the industrial chain, legal and regulatory aspects, and ethical and moral considerations.}

The association between smart growth and housing price is also investigated. The analyses are carried out by applying principal component analysis (PCA), ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Based on both OLS and GWR models, the overall index of urban smart growth positively influences housing prices, albeit the effect size is different in various neighborhoods of the city.}

abstract = {With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), it is considered to be one of the latest innovations that offer interesting opportunities for different vertical industries. One of the most relevant IoT technology areas is smart construction. IoT operates in several sectors on a daily basis; implementation includes smart building, smart grids, smart cities, smart houses, physical defense, e-health, asset, and transportation management, but it is not restricted to this. Support from smart IoT buildings is an IoT-level, connected, and cost-effective system. Commercial space has major requirements in terms of comfort, accessibility, security, and energy management. Such requirements can be served organically by IoT-based systems. As the supply of energy has been exhausted and energy demand has risen, there has been a growing focus on energy usage and the maintenance of buildings. With the use of evolving IoT technology, we present a secure and energy-efficient smart building architecture. Every device is known by its unique address, and one of the key web transfer protocols is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). It is an application layer protocol that does not use protected channels for data transfer. Automatic key management, confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity are all features of the Datagram Transport Layer Protection (DTLS). To achieve energy efficiency, we propose a smart construction architecture that, through IoT, manages the performance of all technological systems. The results of the simulation show that the energy consumption is lowered by about 30.86% with the use of the CoAP in the smart building, which is less than the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport case (MQTT). This paper also aims to observe how to integrate the DTLS protocol with the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256) using optimizations from the Certificate Authority (CA) to improve security.}

This shift to an online society has led social scientists to question the extent to which increased forms of control, surveillance and enforced conformity to ways of thinking, attitudes and behaviors can be promoted through online activities. This question arises overtly amidst a pandemic, but it also lurks behind the widespread diffusion of smart energy systems throughout the world and the increased use of smart meters in those systems. The extent to which forms of monitoring, disciplining and sanctioning of energy behavior and practices could come to reality is thus an important question to consider. This article does so using the ideas of Michel Foucault, together with research on smart energy systems and current trends in energy policy. The article closes with a discussion of energy democracy and democratic legitimacy in the context of possible effects of smart technologies on community energy systems.}

Smart rural communities, enabled by smart technology, are regarded as a potential solution to the challenges posed by aging populations in Korea. However, the sustainable operation of smart rural communities is complex, as a variety of factors should be addressed. To address issues of aging problems in rural communities, this study proposes a priority factor for smart rural community service by applying an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method and in-depth interviews. The AHP model was designed based on a socio-technical system, and an AHP survey was conducted with community leaders who have experience in smart rural community projects. This study proposes a total of 4 criteria and 16 factors along with their corresponding priorities. The results indicate that the local culture is the most important for a sustainable smart rural community compared to other factors. Specifically, factors such as empathy of rural residents, stable financial support, and the presence of smart technology professionals and technical staff are critical for achieving successful smart rural communities for the elderly people. This study found that the cultural and human aspects are more critical for the sustainable operation of smart rural communities than technology infrastructure. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to other countries similar to Korea facing aging problems in rural areas planning to introduce smart rural communities.}

With the advent of smart cities technologies, multi-emergency detection units could be conceived and implemented taking advantage of affordable sensing technologies and efficient decision algorithms, allowing quick and distributed detection of emergencies. However, a recurrent problem has been the positioning and further deployment of such detection units in a way that the particularities of each target city are properly considered. In this sense, this article proposes the processing of geospatial data about existing urban infrastructure associated with some critical response after an emergency is detected, selecting hospitals, police stations, fire departments, and metro stations, in the target city. These infrastructures are then exploited to define the novel concept of mitigation zones, which indirectly express the perceived level of urban resilience to emergencies. Then, four positioning algorithms are proposed to exploit the mitigation zones considering a defined set of available detection units for deployment. Since the proposed approach is valid for any city, provided that geospatial data is available, it could be largely adopted to support different smart city systems, potentially bringing significant results in this area.}

To exploit this potential, flexible and scalable platforms are needed to ease the design, development, deployment, and operations of new city services. In recent years, several problem-specific platforms have been proposed in different application domains; however, to boost the evolution of smart cities, we claim the need for city-oriented platforms that can be easily customized to address different day-to-day life challenging problems. In this paper, we present the main architectural challenges and solutions proposed for the design of a novel open-source platform (named PROMENADE) characterized by: i) a data-driven graph-based modeling support to ensure high generality for addressing disparate problems related to the networked nature of many city infrastructures and systems, ii) the dynamic nature of the graph entities updated in real-time from different sources (e.g., IoT/Edge networks, data providers, etc.), and iii) high efficiency, scalability and flexibility to easily support new city services. The platform is designed around a general-purpose core that provides a set of built-in standard features such as data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization exposed as a collection of containerized microservices. A specialization of the platform has been developed for road networks monitoring. It has been deployed in OpenShift/Kubernetes and tested using realistic datasets collected from the city of Lyon, France. The analysis addresses an important problem of big data processing pipelines: the synchronization between data ingestion and processing in order to produce an accurate result in useful time. To this end, we study different approaches for synchronization and show how the end-to-end latency is kept under control by leveraging the scalability of the platform.}

However, there is a lack in the dataset that can be used to simulate smart city energy consumption and prediction or even smart homes. Therefore, this paper provides a carefully generated dataset for smart home energy management simulation. Five datasets are generated and analysed to ensure suitability, including 20, 50, 100, and 200 homes across 365 days. For more accurate data, energy consumption and production for 50 homes are generated based on real input taken from a dataset for homes in Saudi Arabia. Due to the unavailability of a comprehensive dataset related to the complex scenario of smart home sensors, energy consumption, and peer-to-peer data exchange, synthetic data was generated to support the simulation of smart home energy generation and consumption. This synthetic data plays a crucial role in situations where simulating uncommon events, ensuring data availability, facilitating extensive experimentation and model validation, and enabling scalability are paramount. It offers a valuable opportunity to incorporate these rare yet significant occurrences into the simulation, particularly in the context of infrequent events, such as abnormal energy consumption patterns observed in smart homes. The generated data is analysed and validated in this article, ready to be used for many smart home and city research.}

The indicators were developed by adapting existing indicators in tourism destination management and smart cities literature, creating a new system based on a smart destination theoretical model that establishes three interrelated levels in which smart destinations are grounded: strategic-relational, instrumental and applied levels. Within these levels, nine different dimensions to be measured were identified. The indicators were constructed in collaboration with a public organisation (INVAT.TUR) devoted to providing technical assistance to smart destinations and were pre-tested, readjusted and then applied to a set of destinations of the Region of Valencia (Spain). Obtained findings reveal an uneven performance of destinations in the different dimensions of the three levels. A notable performance is observed in indicators for connectivity and online marketing, while more efforts need to be done in accessibility and sustainability initiatives. However, disparities are evident between different indicators and destinations. These results are discussed and framed within the relevant literature on smart destinations while providing information for destination managers and policy makers to adapt and replicate these indicators in their own territories. This paper is a first attempt to develop and apply indicators to measure smart destinations progress in literature and therefore constitutes an important precedent for future studies.}

Assessing the benefit of using a particular cloud service, especially if such a service is being offered by providers that may be new to the cloud marketplace, remains a challenge. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) provides a certification approach that associates a ranking to providers based on their capability assessment using a “cloud control matrix”. A provider can make a self-assessment, or an assessment can be undertaken by a third party. The intention is to increase user trust in a provider based on their rating using this methodology. This work investigates whether a similar certification methodology can be applied to edge resources, especially if these edge resources are combined with cloud services in a “smart cities” context. Can a CSA-like approach also be used to increase trust in use of edge resources? How would the CSA methodology need to change to support this type of assessment, and how useful is such an approach likely to be in practice? We propose a risk assessment methodology that can be used to address these concerns, and evaluate it in a practical application using both edge and cloud computing resources.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Healthcare is a social and economic challenge in many countries, exacerbated by today’s increasing demand. Many studies demonstrate that hospitals that move towards smartness, and some of their processes are smart, can provide more appropriate treatments and deal with problems more flexibly. It is axiomatic that implementing smart hospitals and healthcare tools requires a clear objective. However, the concept of a smart hospital lacks a comprehensive and broadly accepted definition, leading to varied interpretations and misconceptions. Many developments touted as 'smart' merely digitize existing hospital environments without truly embracing the full potential of smart technology. Furthermore, research studies have neglected to consider industrial perspectives, which will soon cause a gap between industry and academics in this concept.
Objectives
This research aims to explore the attributes of a smart hospital and use them to propose a definition for it, considering both scholarly and industrial viewpoints.
Method and results
The PRISMA method is employed to select academic and practical papers providing definitions and insights into smart hospitals or healthcare. 17 studies are analyzed, and a total, 83 characteristics are identified to describe the smart hospital. These features are categorized into three primary categories: “technologies”, “services”, and “goals”. The most important features are determined by analyzing the frequencies of these characteristics across all the studies. In the results section, these data are presented in graphical form, highlighting both academic and industrial perspectives separately, as well as a combined analysis. Furthermore, an attempt is made to uncover trends in smart hospitals from 2015 to 2023.
Conclusion
A comprehensive definition of the smart hospital, encompassing both academic and industrial perspectives, is proposed using the investigated characteristics. This study also presents research opportunities and discusses the existing gap between academia and industry concerning smart hospitals.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a fundamental component of our everyday existence with the swift advancement in communication technology. Critical infrastructures, smart city monitoring, and smart healthcare systems (SHS) all make significant use of IoT-enabled devices. Nevertheless, the computing power of IoT devices utilized in SHS is constrained. These IoT devices gather sensitive patient data and send it to a medical server. Doctors use IoT-enabled devices to retrieve patient data that has been stored on the medical server using a public communication channel that is susceptible to different types of security attacks. In order to provide information security for IoT-enabled devices with limited resources, the NIST has developed an array of authenticated encryption algorithms. When compared to conventional security techniques, these authenticated encryption algorithms offer computational efficiency. The existing authentication schemes are developed by computationally expensive symmetric and asymmetric encryption schemes and are vulnerable to privileged insider and medical server key compromise attacks. Therefore, this paper introduces a physical unclonable function (PUF) and authenticated encryption (GIFT-COFB)-based authentication framework for IoT-enabled SHS, called PAAF-SHS. PAAF-SHS ensures secure encrypted communication between users and medical servers following mutual authentication. The PUF is incorporated within the medical server and the IoT-enabled device to improve resistance against insider attackers and potential compromises to the medical server key attack. Even in the case of a potential medical server key compromise attack, PAAF-SHS ensures that user-medical server communication remains confidential. The implementation of BAN logic ensures the logical exactitude of PAAF-SHS. Informal security analysis is conducted to validate PAAF-SHS’s resilience against impersonation, replay, and denial-of-service attacks. Security validation using Scyther is performed to illustrate the robustness of PAAF-SHS. Finally, performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PAAF-SHS achieves a significant reduction in computational and communication costs while enhancing security features.}

The multimode fiber sensor is composed of a single mode – multimode – single mode concatenated fiber structure. To explore its practical application for strain monitoring, the sensor is used to measure the strain on a pressurized pipe and its performance compared with the well-developed fiber Bragg grating sensor. The detuning of spectral features of the multimode sensor transmission with increasing pipe pressure is found to have a good linearity (R2 ∼ 0.95) and is more sensitive to strain compared to that of the fiber Bragg grating.}

This information can aid in enforcing waste reduction policies, including the pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) system. However, the public's response to this technology remains uncertain. Despite Japan's reputation for high waste separation compliance and collection rates, it has one of the world's highest per capita rates of plastic and packaging waste generation. This study surveyed 1000 Japanese individuals regarding their perception of smart bin features and their potential to encourage waste reductions. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to explore the relationships between respondents' social attributes and their responses. The findings indicate a slightly higher responses from younger respondents (above 85 % of those age 10–29 compared to around 75 % of those aged 60 and older) who were in favour of smart bin technology functions such as unscheduled waste pick up and automatized waste separation. On the other hand, there was a strong unwillingness (0.57 count ratio) to reduce plastic waste even if a smart bin assisted PAYT is introduced from those who did not engage in waste separation and cleaning in the first place. Finally, an open-ended question about strategies to reduce plastic waste resulted in a large portion of mindset change ideas (24.8 % of the female respondents) and technology innovations proposals (24 % of male respondents). Although development of a smart-bin prototype is taking place, behavioral change strategies to foster a willingness to reduce waste must take place along with technological interventions.}

This study further contributes to the measurement of activity-based social segregation between multiple groups using public transport smart card data. In particular, social segregation is quantified using the ordinal information theory index to measure the income group mix at public transport journey destination zones. The method is applied to the public transport smart card data of Stockholm County, Sweden. Applying the index on 2017–2020 data sets for a selected week, shows significant differences between income groups’ segregation along the radial public transport corridors following the opening of a major rail project in the summer of 2017. The overall slight decrease in segregation over the years can be linked to declining segregation in the city center as a travel destination and its public transport hubs. Increasing zonal segregation is observed in suburban and rural zones with commuter train stations. This method helps to quantify social segregation, enriching the analysis of urban segregation and can aid in evaluating policies based on the dynamics of social life.}

However, existing thermochromic techniques, include VO2- and hydrogel-based systems, have not been used for large-scale in window applications, because of the technical obstacles such as low luminous transmittance (Tlum), poor solar modulation ability (ΔTsol), high transition temperature (Tc) and high haze rate. To tackle those issues, a new thermal-responsive design, i.e., the Ammonia Pressure Powered smart (APPs) window, was proposed, with Cu2+ and sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) providing solar spectrum management. In comparisons to traditional thermochromic windows, the new concept of APPs window shows significant energy-related advances. Particularly, a feasible Tc (24–36 °C), outstanding ΔTsol (67 %), and high Tlum in both cold (84 %) and hot (47.4 %) states are reported in this study. In addition, outdoor experimental test of the APPs window demonstrated that it could produce a rational daylight level of both photopic effects and melanopic effects, whilst reduce the room temperature by about 4 °C on hot sunny day. Furthermore, energy simulations conducted for the APPs window in three different cities (Singapore, Hong Kong and Harbin) indicate its superior performance, compared to the double-layered low-e glazing windows, across various climatic conditions. With cost-effective materials and excellent performance, the authors believe that this new APPs window represents a smart and sustainable solution for the development of next-generation green buildings.}

For PEVs, this paradigm shift requires attention to the impact of home charging on the grid in an era where distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels and batteries, are being commercially deployed. To understand the integration of light-duty PEVs with residential DERs, a model is developed to simulate PEV charging demand profiles in combination with field data from three different home groups of varying DER configurations. A valley-filling smart charging algorithm is explored to optimize vehicle charging, more effectively utilize solar PV, reduce emissions, and reduce peak demand. The results show that (1) the impact on transformer hot spot temperature and loss of life is acceptable for all cases, (2) smart charging can increase transformer life, (3) while PEV deployment reduces GHG emissions, additional reduction can be achieved through the integration of DERs and smart charging, and (4) the addition of DERs and implementation of smart charging virtually eliminate the negative impacts of PEVs on distribution grid infrastructure, increases PV penetration, and reduces emissions and peak demand.}

abstract = {The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens.}

The recent COVID-19 outbreak has exposed the fragility of islands that depend on tourism, especially those built around mass tourism. For these islands that are highly dependent on external tourism, basing the recovery on proximity tourism is not a valid option. In order to find a solution for these destinations, the available literature and proposals on recovering tourism after the COVID-19 crisis were reviewed and framed in an integrated smart tourism destination framework that was proposed. These actions were then validated using a Delphi method with 36 participants from all the stakeholders in the island of Gran Canaria, Spain. The most agreed-upon actions regarded developing new business models around tourism and new sectors of economic activity, ensuring the health and safety of those involved in tourism, helping tourism companies financially, and explaining the situation of the destination in the origin markets. The results demonstrated that, far from the rhetoric sometimes associated with smart tourism destinations’ proposals and actions, using concrete and specific actions oriented to specific cases can provide a valuable roadmap for destination management, crisis management preparation, and post-crisis recuperation.}

In this scenario, the exploration of the conceptualisation of Smart Systems has been addressed in the scientific literature with the objective to understand the characteristics of such systems and the implications of their use. However, there is a lack of a generic view of the concept since most studies focus on specific domains. This view is necessary to provide common ground for the development or implementation of Smart Systems within various domains, specially for those that have not been tackled yet. This work aims at addressing this issue through the exploration and analysis of conceptualisations of Smart Systems and Smartness within the scientific literature. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review is performed aiming at gathering papers including definitions of Smart Systems, regardless of the application domain. Text mining processing techniques are applied to obtain insights from the definitions extracted from the collected papers. Considering the findings of the literature review and the analysis of the extracted definitions, we enumerate and describe a set of characteristics of Smart Systems. We also provide a diagrammatic view of the elements of a Smart System and their relationships through a meta-model.}

Egypt is certainly no exception and in recent years there is growing research evidence to this effect. However, more knowledge is needed on how to develop affordable and locally viable solutions that are integrated into the urban planning process from the outset. This article discusses the results of the “Energy Efficiency Feasibility Assessment of the Master Plan of Nabta Smart Town (NST)”, an “education town” under planning in New Borg el Arab City (NBC), close to Alexandria. The results show how an early energy assessment, carried out as early as the planning stage, which considers local regulations and specific conditions, can help achieve considerable energy efficiency in the future by identifying affordable, evidence-based, and locally feasible solutions that can be further optimized at the design stage. Therefore, the value of this study is not in proposing a new standard solution for everyone, but in showing through an application example how the potential of an early energy assessment at the neighborhood/precinct level can be realized in practice. The immediate benefit is in promoting greater energy efficiency through the design and optimization of renewable energies and passive solutions. This achievement can in turn be used to rethink the planning and decision-making process in the local context. The greatest impact is not only in the selected case study, but in its potential for replicability throughout the Global South.}

Smart greenhouses need to monitor physical parameters for the healthy growth of plants from remote locations. A digital twin is a representation of physical assets in the digital world, and this emerging technology has opened up opportunities for efficient system development for Industry 4.0. The digital twin receives real-time operational data to monitor the asset in the digital domain. It performs real-time processing, data analysis, and machine learning to predict optimized decisions. In the era of next-generation mobile networks, IoT devices can communicate and perform their remote operations in a timely manner. In smart greenhouse technology, the digital twin could be a revolutionary substitute for real-time remote monitoring and process management. However, there has been limited work on digital twin-driven smart greenhouse technology. In this paper, a process management framework is developed that can be interpreted as a machine learning and cloud-based data-driven digital twin for smart greenhouses. The proposed framework consists of three layers: the physical, fog, and cloud layers. The physical greenhouse measurements are monitored using a highly immersive cloud-based, real-time 3D environment. We present an example architecture using commercial cloud and open-source tools to verify the proof of concept. Additionally, different ML techniques are utilized to predict the operational requirements for smart greenhouses.}

abstract = {The development of emerging smart grid technologies has led to more and more penetration of renewable energy resources and electric energy storage in the residential sectors. Besides, owing to the significant evolution of power electronic devices, there is a rapid growth in penetration of DC loads and generations, such as PV and electric vehicles (EVs), into the buildings and homes as a building block of the future smart cities. This is despite the fact that the electricity infrastructure of the conventional buildings is designed based on AC electricity and as a result, there would be a lot of losses due to the frequent power conversion from AC to DC and vice versa. Besides, according to a significant amount of energy consumption in the residential sector, buildings have a prominent role to confront environmental problems and obtain sustainability. In such circumstances, and considering the energy outlook, rethinking the electrification structure of the built environment is necessary. This work is an effort in this regard and looks for a sustainable energy infrastructure for the cyber–physical homes of the future. Three disparate electrification architectures are analyzed. The proposed framework, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, not only considers costs associated with investment and operation but also evaluates the reliability of each structure by considering the different ratios of DC loads. Moreover, the optimal size of renewable energy resources and the effect of EV demand response, and different prices of PV and battery are precisely investigated. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated via numerical simulation.}

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a critical problem that drives consideration of smart cities and urban areas' development. Energy security and the smart environment face enormous problems because of the dramatic rise in energy consumption brought on by rising population levels and the widespread use of new data-collecting technologies. Traditional smart grids can be updated with IoT-based smart metering (SM) and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies by revealing previously hidden information about electrical power by implementing a communication system between utilities and consumers during the power transaction process. The smart distribution and energy consumption in smart city environments are strongly supported by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Hence, this paper suggests the IoT and AI-assisted Smart Metering System (IoT–AI–SMS) as a new data acquisition equipment for predicting energy consumption in smart cities. The information is taken from Energy Efficiency Datasets to examine smart cities' energy consumption. This research offers a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for load forecasting using smart meter data. This technique allows training a single model with all participating smart meters without exchanging local information. Considering the customers' needs, the model developed scheduled the controllable loads and offered optimal dispatch of distributed generation in the smart grid.}

Within the public sector, smart city has become a popular term and municipal governments around the world are using multiple strategies to become smarter. However, there is no consensus about what smartness means and how to identify its key components or dimensions. Some definitions highlight information technology and data, while others pay attention to sustainability, openness, innovation, or resiliency. Based on a review of current literature, this paper identifies multiple dimensions of smartness and proposes an integrative view that highlights how each dimension contributes to the understanding and development of smart governments. We argue that smartness should be conceptualized in a broad and multifaceted way. The framework we present serves as a foundation to understand and measure smartness in government and provides guidelines for the comprehensive development of smart governments. Some of the dimensions have been identified and studied explicitly in the realm of smart government. A number of other dimensions are embedded in the literature as individual characteristics of a good government; although they are not explicitly referenced in relationship to smart government, we argue that they are important components of a government being smart. The paper also suggests that public managers do not control all dimensions equally. Some dimensions could be seen as relatively direct outputs of their actions, while others could be better understood as outcomes that could be affected, but not solely determined, by strategic interventions or deliberate actions.}

abstract = {This study was aimed at examining the impacts of climate variability on vegetable production and nexus climate-smart agriculture technologies. The study was conducted on vegetable farmers along the little Akaki River in Addis Ababa. Field data was collected from 156 randomly selected vegetable farmers via semi-structured survey questions. Climate data from 1996 to 2020 was analysed using qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistics methods. The results of monthly and annual precipitation variability indicated a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 23% to 73% and 49% to 98%, respectively. Seasonally, CV ranges between 34% and 99%, 50%–97%, and 20%–84% in Belg, Bega, and Kiremt, respectively. The results of respondents' perceptions indicated an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation variability. Vegetable urban farmers perceived an increase in the frequency of floods and rain falls (44.9%), drought frequency (13.5%), temperature (89.7%), and a decrease in the trend of vegetable productivity (86.5%) as the major impacts of climate variability. However, changing vegetable varieties (31.4%), early planting (26.9%), mixed farming (26.6%), late planting (5.1%), using agrochemicals (4.5%), and agroforestry (1.9%) are the major on-farm climates where smart agriculture technologies were identified for adaptation. Shift occupation (37.8%), nonadaptation (36.5%), and non-farm activations (24.4%) were employed by the farmers as off-farm adaptation options. In addition, vulnerability analysis indicated that the absence of direct access to the market, inadequate access to weather information, land fragmentation, and tenure complications are the major determinants of being vulnerable. Finally, high precipitation and temperature variability affect vegetable productivity.
Practical Implications
Climate extreme phenomena are substantial pressures on urban agricultural production systems in risk-prone cities, where climate service challenges are rising globally (Sanfo et al., 2022, Kifle et al., 2022, Ebissa and Desta, 2022); besides, the requirement to produce more urban vegetables to feed residents, an ever-increasing and vulnerable group, is undeniable (Martinez et al., 2022). Additionally, climate variability and change threaten urban and pre-urban farmers’ livelihoods and agricultural farming, particularly in semi-arid areas in Africa (Magesa et al., 2023). Furthermore, 64 % of the world’s poorest people lived in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, which strongly requires the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 11 (make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) in the region (Magesa et al., 2023, Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021, Degefu et al., 2021c). Thus, cities are exposure to compatible climate information services is vital for anticipating climate variability risks in vegetable production, optimizing the training of practitioners (urban farmers), and adapting to climate change through climate smart agriculture technologies (Degefu et al., 2021a, Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021, Kifle et al., 2022). Moreover, it is compulsory to ascertain and analyze impact insights and their origins, vulnerabilities, and adaptive potential among urban farmers before beginning with the exercise of any given climate service to understand the demands of urban vegetable farmers and the possible exploitation of nexuses (Dendir and Simane, 2021). Conversely, in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is identified as one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change and vulnerability (Kifle et al., 2022). On top of these, the productivity and the concern of urban agriculture (vegetable production) is highly ignored and reduced the potential, productivity and suitability of ecological land (Kifle et al., 2022, Degefu et al., 2021b, Degefu et al., 2021c). Besides, the combined effect of climate variability, population pressure, and urban ecosystem dynamics reduced urban vegetable production and leads the farming community into a viscous of poverty circle and worsens food security (Amberber et al., 2020, Degefu et al., 2021c). However, previous studies have revealed that the effectiveness of climate information services on urban ecosystems depends on (i) the ability of urban farmers to access, understand, and overcome institutional constraints (Kiplagat et al., 2022) (ii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Dendir and Simane, 2021), and (iii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Martinez et al., 2022). To that end, the disparity between the awareness of urban farmers and policymakers towards the benefits of CSA and their practices implies that indigenous knowledge-based research on CSA farming and land management technology should be conducted. Therefore, it is crucial to appreciate the practices and adoption of CSA at the city level to realise triple-win outcomes: increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and mitigating climate variability and change.}

This makes it possible for the system to recognize, react to, and resolve various problems. Power users of digital technology can take an active role and have the ability to cure themselves. Cybercrimes affecting the security of the smart grid include the compromise of vital client data by attackers, the spread of viruses, cybersecurity mistakes, and vulnerabilities in distributed systems. In order to identify the multi-stage cyberattacks that pose a threat to the smart grid, a novel Multi-Stage Cyber Intelligence (MSCI) technique has been developed in this work. A signal is generated by an intrusion detection system (IDS) sensor and passed through a Chebyshev filter for preprocessing in order to minimize its noise level. The risk will be identified by the security identification block, which also includes risk assessment, risk estimation, and risk identification. The Risk Identification Block finds the risk by gaining access to the Cyber Information Database. If the risk is not found, it is transmitted to the BI-LSTM Network, which verifies if it is an attack. A MATLAB simulator is used to implement the proposed approach. Evaluation criteria like Precision, F1 Score, Specificity, Accuracy, and Detective Rate have been used to assess the effectiveness of the Multi-Stage Cyber Intelligence (MSCI) technique approach that has been provided. The experimental results show that the suggested MSCI strategy has a 99% success rate, which is comparatively high when compared to the current approaches of 9.09%, 22.22%, and 47.47% for the CDS, AD-IOT, and SVM techniques, respectively.}

However, in rural environments, the effective management and intelligent control of green energy face many challenges. To address these issues, this work aims to design a smart home system based on blockchain technology to achieve efficient energy management and intelligent control in a green lighting environment in rural areas. The main goals include improving the performance and safety of the system to meet the lighting needs of rural areas and promote sustainable development. The system comprises two primary components: the home gateway and cloud services. These components encompass functions like data monitoring and transmission, cloud storage, and remote control. The work also introduces the structural interaction, user node interaction, and the data security transmission scheme of the smart home system. Ultimately, the system's effectiveness is confirmed through simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the system achieves the lowest latency when the transaction arrival rate is 40tps and the block size is 10. Additionally, the access control scheme based on the Hyperledger Fabric consortium chain can efficiently handle access requests for smart home resources and meet the practical application requirements within an appropriate range of security parameters. The main research conclusion is that the designed smart home system based on blockchain technology has achieved significant results in improving performance and security. This not only provides reliable lighting solutions for rural areas, but also provides important theoretical and practical guidance for the future development of smart home systems. The direction of future work includes further optimizing system performance, expanding the scope of application, and exploring more advanced blockchain technology applications in the field of smart homes. This will provide more possibilities and innovative directions for the development of future smart home systems.}

The various aspects of the smart city can be improved through digital transformation, sustainability, resource management, improved quality of life, and security because of emerging applications such as voice recognition, image sensing, and so on. There is a massive deployment of smart devices and sensors, which sense, collect, and process a large amount of data. So there are many critical strategies and intelligent computing is required. The most popular way to solve computational issues with conventional blocks and structures to achieve exact, deterministic results is hard computing. However, emerging applications are tolerant towards errors, so the need for a precise result is diminishing. Approximate computing is a new paradigm in the field where error tolerance is applicable; it relaxes the need for an accurate and deterministic result while also providing advantages in terms of area, time, and delay. In this paper, we proposed a novel approximate computation based on a systematic approach that utilises the Look-Up-Table (LUT) with specific errors to achieve an approximate arithmetic circuit. Approximate adder circuit is designed so that this technique can be reused for different designs deployed in various applications or IoT devices. The analysis is based on area, delay with a considered error percentage. The proposed arithmetic circuit achieves a 68 % reduction in chip area compared to the exact one with a delay of 6.159 ns. The results show that the designed approximate arithmetic circuit is smaller in size, and energy-efficient and can be exploited to implement circuits used in IoT devices.}

In this paper, an IoT based Smart AgroTech system is proposed in the context of urban farming that considers humidity, temperature, and soil moisture as necessary farming parameters. The proposed system decides whether the irrigation action should begin or stop depending on the farming land condition and provides the monitoring facility and remote control to the farm owner. The system's reliability is verified by determining the error percentage between actual data and observed data at different observations. The average error rate for humidity and soil moisture is below 3% and for temperature is below 1.5%.

This characteristic makes smart urban metabolism a strategic tool for urban policymakers and managers, and planners. Nonetheless, little is known on about the indicators of smart urban metabolism. This study aims to shed light on what the specific indicators of smart urban metabolism are. The paper places international standards and indicators of urban systems under the microscope to determine their focus, and areas of action. The analysis exposes divergences in urban system evaluation approaches by international standardization organizations—particularly with a focus on whether they concentrate on urban smartness or urban metabolism. The results of the analysis demonstrate a challenge in integrating urban metabolism with urban smartness. In this sense, there is no international standard taken into consideration thus far. The study points out to a novel and invaluable approach to improve the understanding and awareness on internationally standardized urban indicators that characterize, and stimulate the knowledge on smart urban metabolism.}

abstract = {Energy generation and management are relevant for both utilities and electricity users, and they can be improved by incorporating sophisticated technology on smart grid. This opens up the possibility of transforming existing industries into a new era of enhanced networks that will give an intelligent, responsive, and bi-directional automatic management system for power generation, transmission, and distribution. The traditional grid is transitioning from a centralized generation structure to a more dispersed smart grid structure. In order to build this new decentralized structure, loads must be fully integrated into the grid and adequately separated from the main grid. The smart grid allows for the integration of loads that are clean, cost-effective, and efficient. The growing level of distributed generation (DG) integration puts the grid under strain, resulting in perturbations with dynamic responses. This paper discussed a detailed review of current developments in smart grid through the integration of renewable energy resources (RERs) into the grid. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive, up-to-date review of RERs integration on grid to evaluate research directions, progress, challenges, and potential solutions. It focuses on the concepts and structure of smart grids, followed by an in-depth examination of smart grid overview, energy sources, inertia issues, and applications. This evaluation will assist other researchers investigating smart grid energy resources in identifying research problems and gaps.}

Herein, a novel TENG composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) functionalized with electron-donating groups from Clitoria ternatea (CT) flower extract is proposed. The compatibility of composite film in energy harvesting devices is tested through various characterizations, including structural, surface, electrical, and bioassay. Interestingly, the enhanced tribopositivity of the composite is attributed to intermolecular hydrogen bonding between taraxerol and PVA, substantiated by Hartree-Fock-DFT calculated vibrational spectrum, frontier molecular orbital energy gap, and electrostatic potential maps. TENG with PVA-CT: Polyurethane generated an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 14.8 times and short-circuit current (ISC) of 32.7 times, more significant than PVA TENG and several bio/non-biodegradable tribonegative polymers. The long-term stability test of PVA-CT TENG is confirmed by an observation of constant VOC for eight consecutive months. Additionally, humidity studies reveal that output increases with an increase in relative humidity of 30–100%. Further, the PVA-CT TENG is efficient in charging capacitors, powering LEDs, and acts as a self-powered smart counter. Overall, this study contributes new insights into developing eco-friendly synergistic materials for TENG fabrication and extending its applications in the Internet of Things, facilitating to build of futuristic smart cities.}

The objective of this model is to facilitate timely planning of repair and maintenance activities, ensuring prolonged availability of the smart trash bin after identifying the weakest component/components of the system. The efficient functioning of all components in the smart trash bin is imperative for the timely transmission of the garbage level data to the municipal corporation. To achieve this, the paper focuses on evaluating key reliability metric for smart trash bin system, specifically reliability, unreliability, and Mean time to Failure (MTTF). The modelling approach employs a state-based Markov model, from which Kolmogorov differential equations are derived and subsequently solved using Laplace transformation. After collecting data from organization and experts of the field explicit expression for system reliability, unreliability and MTTF have been obtained. Furthermore, this study includes sensitivity analysis of the system to pinpoint critical components which is switch and servo motor, requiring attention for proper maintenance. The research finding indicates that reliability and MTTF of the system diminish as the failure rate of the components increase under certain conditions.}

This paper goes behind the headlines and self-labelling, and compares the region’s major planned cities in terms of the nature of the urban development models. It proposes a techno-social framework to characterize the cities based on the criteria of access and innovation. The assessment shows that most developments resemble infrastructure upgrade via digital and smart cities. While ecological innovations are incorporated in urban design, they are limited to few livable cities. Most representative cities for sustainability are either small theme cities or yet to be completed. Economization and mega-events are largely fuelling urban development, with open outcomes on the success to attract long-term residents, and the level of contribution to the region’s low-carbon future.}

In this societal change, universities must maintain their leading role. Historically, they set trends primarily in education but now they are called to drive the change in other aspects too, such as management, safety, and environment protection. The availability of newer and newer technology reflects on how the relevant processes should be performed in the current fast changing digital era. This leads to the adoption of a variety of smart solutions in university environments to enhance the quality of life and to improve the performances of both teachers and students. Nevertheless, we argue that being smart is not enough for a modern university. In fact, universities should better become smarter. By “smarter university” we mean a place where knowledge is shared between employees, teachers, students, and all stakeholders in a seamless way. In this paper we propose, and discuss a smarter university model, derived from the one designed for the development of smart cities.}

In the smart city, where data is both ubiquitous and continuous, it is possible to use metadata to quickly gain an understanding of how the future city is designed and how the current urban system can be altered. Existing building energy data of eight housing units in the Sumida neighborhood of Tokyo was collected using smart meters. This data was analyzed to determine how the buildings perform in real-time, compared to how the energy models predict the building performance. This comparison showed that the existing buildings are using more energy than the current models predict. There is potential that better utilizing data can help designers and planners come closer to meeting community goals. There is also potential that as we integrate more smart city technologies into our cities for improving future city model, or the change model in Geodesign.

This paper takes a local voltage-control strategy for smart LV distribution networks, by using a fuzzy based methodology using local information collected from smart meters as status information source of the grid. Comparative studies are presented for a smart home LV distribution system to validate the method, showing the robustness of proposed method compared with the traditional local approaches. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, a real-time digital simulator for smart distribution power grids with a the developed voltage-control system are used. The results show the proposed method can simultaneously mitigate the PV reactive power injection, as well as minimize the voltage rise and power losses.}

This study explores the impact of Smart home dimensions on highly-educated students, drawn from what is known as the “digital native” population, one of the key components of the smart living concept. As digital natives are already engaged with the adoption of new technologies and sustainable development, we have postulated that they would be keen to use smart technologies in the home that could improve their daily life while preserving the environment. This study tests a scale developed to measure consumer perception of the Smart Home Concept (SHC) and the impact on “Performance Expectancy” and “Habit”. The model was built using some of the constructs of existing technology acceptance models, such as the UTAUT2 and TAM2 models. Based on our findings, digital natives seem ready to adopt the SHC and our results highlight the fact that Smart Home products could be targeted at this specific population.}

However, many existing city requirements are written in English with missing, inaccurate, or ambiguous information. There is a high demand for assisting city policymakers in converting human-specified requirements to machine-understandable formal specifications for monitoring systems. To tackle this limitation, we build CitySpec (Chen et al., 2022), the first intelligent assistant system for requirement specification in smart cities. To create CitySpec, we first collect over 1,500 real-world city requirements across different domains (e.g., transportation and energy) from over 100 cities and extract city-specific knowledge to generate a dataset of city vocabulary with 3,061 words. We also build a translation model and enhance it through requirement synthesis and develop a novel online learning framework with shielded validation. The evaluation results on real-world city requirements show that CitySpec increases the sentence-level accuracy of requirement specification from 59.02% to 86.64%, and has strong adaptability to a new city and a new domain (e.g., the F1 score for requirements in Seattle increases from 77.6% to 93.75% with online learning). After the enhancement from the shield function, CitySpec is now immune to most known textual adversarial inputs (e.g., the attack success rate of DeepWordBug (Gao et al., 2018) after the shield function is reduced to 0% from 82.73%). We test the CitySpec with 18 participants from different domains. CitySpec shows its strong usability and adaptability to different domains, and also its robustness to malicious inputs.}

The paper examines this question and assesses the notion of smart urban mobility as a combination of sustainability and innovation. This approach offers a comprehensive and practical framework for benchmarking cities in accordance with the smartness of their transportation systems. The methodology is based on the identification of quantitative indicators that evaluate urban mobility through a synthetic parameter known as the Smart Mobility Index. Although this Index can be applied to any city worldwide, the research focuses on the Spanish context, with a selection of six cases of different sizes and urban typologies. The results highlight the features that most influence the smartness of a city’s mobility, and can be used to design the appropriate transport policies. Finally, the cities are ranked according to the performance of their smart transportation systems.}

In a diagnosis stage, a detailed pollutant concentration map is computed using CFD to identify critical highly polluted areas. Then, in a remediation stage, the optimal placement of depolluting panels as regards of urban airflow is determined to locally mitigate the air pollution in the exposed areas. For this purpose, a spatial sensitivity indicator calculated from an adjoint framework is proposed. The approach is applied to two real case studies: the full-scale laboratory district “Sense-City” under controlled conditions and a district area in Paris using realistic NOx traffic emission and wind conditions. In both case studies, it is shown that depolluting panels should be placed on a part of the sidewalks, the building facades and the roads adjacent to the sidewalks to reduce the high NOx concentration on some sidewalks and on first-floor building windows, thus preventing outdoor/indoor pollutant transfer. It is also proven that the proposed strategy is more efficient than a non-smart massive deployment of depolluting panels to improve the air quality in exposed areas. In addition to practical recommendations, this numerical strategy can provide a help-decision tool for city managers to design depolluting panels-based mitigation actions.}

In this context, by introducing and leveraging advanced networking (e.g., Web 3.0), digitalization (e.g., mixed reality (MR)), and intellectualization (e.g., AI generated content(AIGC)) technologies, Smart PSS has embarked on the second revolution, as the so-called Smart PSS 2.0. To better distinguish such a new paradigm, this paper begins with a systematic review of the existing Smart PSS works, covering its 3 unique solution design characteristics (i.e., value co-creation, closed-loop design, and context awareness). Comparatively, it is found that proactive interaction design, human-SCPs symbiosis, and AIGC-enabled collaborative intelligence become new design features of Smart PSS 2.0. To unlock its power, illustrative examples with underlined technologies and value propositions are given in a grand vision.

Due to its low power consumption, simple setup, and large communication range, LoRaWAN smart parking devices are already employed to reduce congestion and improve quality of life. This paper studies privacy leakage of LoRaWAN smart parking communication devices. Namely, when a vehicle as a metallic obstacle obscures the LoRaWAN smart parking device, the signal strength will be significantly reduced on the receiver side. Consequently, the variation in the signal strength of LoRaWAN parking systems transmits information about parking space occupancy, allowing the implementation of a passive side-channel attack at large distances. Using supervised machine learning techniques based on Neural Network, the attacker can estimate parking lot occupancy with accuracy up to 97%, while Random Forrest approach reaches the accuracy over 98%.}

Sustainable development is the working basis of engineering research and cities are becoming increasingly flexible, inclusive and intelligent. In this context, there is a need for environments that emulate real-life spaces in which cutting-edge technologies can be implemented for subsequent deployment in society. Smart Labs or Living Labs are spaces for innovation, research and experimentation that integrate systems, devices and methodologies focused on people and their environments. The technologies studied and developed in such labs can then be deployed in human spaces to provide intelligence, comfort, health and sustainability. Health and wellness, energy and environment, artificial intelligence, big data and digital rights are some of the disciplines being studied. At the same time, the UN 2030 Agenda provides a comprehensive framework to promote human well-being through the Sustainable Development Goals. In this work, an evaluation model of its indicators in smart environments is performed through a mixed review methodology. The objective of this work is the analysis and implementation of the SDGs in Smart Labs through a literature review and a case study of UJAmI, the smart laboratory of the University of Jaén. The results provide quantitative and qualitative data on the present and future of the smart devices implemented in the UJAmI lab, providing a roadmap for future developments.}

Although technology develops very fast nowadays, we are not able to implement it in a daily life at the same pace, specifically in such ecosystem as a city. Thus, there is a clear lag in the deployment of technologies and services in smart city applications versus what those technologies enable. Therefore, it is crucial to build a bottom-up approach that could support development and implementation of solutions that respond to actual users’ needs. In Chapter 1 the main hypothesis of the paper is introduced. Chapter 2 demonstrates how the concept of smart city has changed since early 2000’s, from technology driven to citizen co-creation. In Chapter 3 the work outlines two topics. Firstly, the paradigm of technological advances, their development in cities and the concept of cascading trap of technology. Secondly, the major features of smart city and their limitations. In Chapter 4 this paper outlines the concrete solutions on how to combine social and technological innovations.}

The European Cities Mission launched a call in September 2021 to set out on a path towards “100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030”. A very large and diverse sample of 344 candidate cities in 35 countries (a subset of the 362 considered eligible to participate in the Cities Mission) was used to conduct this timely research aimed at identifying the main dimensions on which cities are working to achieve a smart and sustainable transition. The research focused on five main dimensions: local climate planning, climate emergency declarations, participation in networks, international projects and competitions. Results show that only 20 (5.8%) cities have no experience in any of them, while there are 18 (5.2%) cities that have in their background activities that fall under all dimensions. Moreover, networking is the most important dimension, among the five analysed, for cities applying for this Mission, involving 309 cities (approximately 90% of the sample). This is followed by local climate planning, involving 275 cities (80%) and city participation in international projects, involving 152 cities (44%). Cities that have declared a climate emergency are less than a fifth of the sample and are very unevenly distributed in only 37.1% of the countries represented (interestingly, all the UK cities in the sample). Similarly, only 49 cities (14.2%) have received international awards. The results provide insights into the main efforts currently being made by cities to engage in the transition to climate neutrality and may be useful to practitioners, scholars and policy-makers at all levels to improve their knowledge of the steps they need to take to support this process and amplify its scope.}

This study extends the environmental literature by investigating whether ICT helps to improve environmental protection when adopted in urban areas, using a panel dataset comprising 60 developing and 34 developed countries between 1998 and 2016. Empirically, we employ the 2-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) strategy including two empirical specifications: with and without control variables. The estimates show that (1) ICT adoption within urban areas can improve environmental quality for developing and developed countries. For instance, a 10% rise in the interaction between ICTs and urbanization can reduce pollution between 1% and 6.5% for developed countries. (2) The variables urbanization and ICTs negatively affect environmental protection. (3) Telephone use within urban areas is more efficient in reducing environmental damages compared to mobile phones and internet technologies. (4) The positive effect of the interaction between ICTs and urbanization is very weak for developing economies. A 10% rise in the association between urbanization and ICTs can reduce pollution by between 0.1% and 1%. Public policies should concentrate on the adoption of ICT inside urban areas to ensure environmental protection. The integration of the smart cities approach can help in reducing urban pollution.}

The results of more than ten years of demonstration projects operation research indicate that the use of distributed renewable energy and power technologies such as energy storage, energy efficiency management, and demand response has enabled buildings to save energy consumption, improve the proportion and quality of green electricity, meet the peak shaving and valley filling of the power grid, and ultimately reduce carbon emissions. Not only does it reduce energy consumption by more than 15% for users, but it also provides a more comfortable and convenient building environment. The most important thing is to verify the effectiveness and long-term reliability of smart grid technology in promoting green and low-carbon buildings on the power user side. Furthermore, it provides valuable experience for the renovation and construction of low-carbon and flexible electricity-load buildings in the future.}

The method involves steps that profile the characteristics of these cities, enunciate cross-cutting patterns in cities’ visions by thematic groupings, and compare 14 contextual factors with 77 possible main barriers. There are both similarities and differences among the results as a basis for learning together and certain barriers can be relatively more dominant in some thematic groupings, such as fragmentation of responsibilities. As a synthesis of the main findings, the original analyses are used to derive and prioritise nine high-level recommendations based on the cities' visions, contextual factors, and expected main barriers. Opportunities for mobilising transformative change relate to transforming siloed into integrated approaches, inclusive climate governance and collaborations, innovative financing, welfare and just transition as well as planning, implementation, and policy coherence.

Addressing this gap, we aimed to investigate households' energy practices in a Positive Energy Neighbourhood in Norway, focusing on the role of smart technologies for demand-side reduction and flexibility. A mixed methods approach was applied, combining in-depth and semi-structured interviews, house tours, actual energy consumption, and simulated solar energy production presented as narratives. The results indicated the need to rethink smart energy technologies to address the collective nature of PEDs/PENs by showing that (i) different ways of interpreting and domesticating these technologies impact demand reduction and flexibility of households with implications at the neighbourhood level, (ii) the individualistic design approach of smart energy technologies does not afford community interaction in terms of knowledge transfer and collective engagement, and (iii) collective representations of energy affordability and convenience attributed to such technologies may act as barriers to households' engagement with demand-side strategies. These results can be seen as recommendations for PEDs/PENs stakeholders and policies to foster the development of community-based smart energy technologies.}

abstract = {Urban public space is often provided for freight delivery operations in the form of on-street (un)loading zones (LZ). Since public space is scarce and demanded by several users, city authorities have the challenge of managing LZ by gaining knowledge about freight curbside needs and utilization. Although technological solutions and enforcement practices have become popular among policymakers to capture curbside dynamics, there is still an open and promising research field for designing analytical frameworks that shape LZ decision-making processes. This fact has motivated the authors to define the concept of Smart Loading Zones (SLZ) as the involvement of technology and data analytics in the planning and management of LZ in a responsive and user-oriented way. Besides proposing a conceptual approach for the study of SLZ, this paper implements data analytics tools for enhancing decisions on LZ network design, using the City of Vic (Spain) as a case study. The machine learning techniques k-means++, DBSCAN, and integer linear programming prescribed the LZ number, location and service assignment based on establishments' coordinates, walking distances and freight demand. Results from the case study showed how an optimized number, location, and size of LZ improved occupation levels, i.e., from 18 % to 80 %, while freeing up curbside space for other users. Service coverage was also improved by allocating LZ to establishments within walking distances no greater than 75 m. Further development of methods and tools for SLZ at tactical and operational decisions are recommended for future studies.}

Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. ‘Smart’ is the order of the day. Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: “connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable”. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer together towards a common framework for urban mobility development.}

In addition, attackers can send large numbers of authentication and data access requests to spread malware across the smart communities’ network and cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes SPrivAD, a secure and privacy-preserving mutually dependent authentication and data access solution by which smart communities’ assets such as users, devices, and apps can authenticate each other before allowing data access. SPrivAD uses an Inter-Attribute-based Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (IA-ZKPK) protocol based on computational attributes of cryptographic operations, and cryptographic identities of the assets to perform Mutually Dependent Multi-Factor Authentication and Data Access (MDMFA). The computational attributes such as message size and number of executed steps of cryptographic operations are features derived from the knowledge of cryptographic operations between the assets. Our approach for deriving a unique, deactivatable, and revocable cryptographic identity is based on the secrets of an asset in a modified Elliptic Curve Pedersen Commitment Scheme (EC-PCS) with security and privacy guarantees. We implement a prototype of SPrivAD and evaluate it with respect to its security, privacy, and performance. The results show that it is secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient for mutually dependent authentication and data access in smart communities. Furthermore, we design and analyse a new attack, Smart Communities Authentication Bypass Attack (SCABA), on real-world authentication and secure access schemes such as Ruckus Cloudpath Enrollment System and Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). This type of attack exploits valid credentials of smart communities’ assets. We show that SPrivAD mitigates SCABA.}

abstract = {Electricity consumption has been intensifying due to population growth, climate change, urbanization, and the growing use of electronic devices, which are increasingly non-linear loads that cause poor power quality conditions. The trend of the Internet of Things has led to the creation of devices that encourage the efficient and effective utilization of electrical power. This in turn facilitates the development of modern power distribution structures such as smart grids. Consequently, this paper presents in detail the design, construction, and validation of a three-phase IoT smart meter intended to form part of the end-user demand side of a smart grid. The compact embedded system, with a manufacturing cost below $80 USD, features a unique electronic design that enables its installation in any load center and employs a straightforward IoT structure that includes WiFi technology for Internet communication. Also, a deployed web application was developed specifically to display the smart meter measurements. Unlike other smart meters, the proposed meter not only provides the amount of active energy consumption, but total and fundamental RMS current and voltage, active, reactive, and apparent power, reactive energy, power factor, and some power quality parameters such as, line frequency, amplitude of 64 current harmonics, and total harmonic distortion. Additionally, this study shows that the prototype achieves an absolute error of less than 1% in all its measurements. Finally, real-life applications of the developed device are demonstrated in residential environments.}
